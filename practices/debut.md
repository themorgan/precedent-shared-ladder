## Rule
**Debut is step 4 of the five-stage ladder ([promote](promote.md)): a
Promote from pre-staging into staging.** It runs exactly what
[Promote](promote.md) runs with the step named:

    python3 tools/precedent_branches.py --promote --to staging --work BRANCH

([tools/precedent_branches.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/precedent_branches.py)), and everything Promote says holds:
the lock, the full local check on the batch, nothing moving unless it
passes. Work still on this session's feature branch goes through
[Booked](go-update.md) first, and the read-back names both stages.

**When a Debut is refused, fix what it named, then run every step once in
the session before booking and trying again** -- `## Detail` has the
command (Morgan, 2026-10-01, strength: assented).

**Where a repository has no pre-staging** -- a person who lands on staging
-- Debut has nothing to do, and says so.

## Detail
A refusal shows only part of what is wrong: the push check stops at its
first failing step, and a test that crashes takes the rest of its batch
down with it. So after fixing what it named, run:

    PRECEDENT_PUSH_CHECK_ALL=1 python3 tools/precedent_push_check.py --tier full --because "a Debut was refused"

Fix all of what that finds, book it, and Debut again. The next Debut reuses
that pass for the same files rather than running it a second time.

## Why
"Debut" names the step for what it means: the work's first appearance where
it is fully checked, ready to be judged for production.

## Story
Named 2026-09-27 with the rest of the ladder.

**2026-10-01: five Debuts for one batch.** A change booked earlier that
day broke tests only the full suite runs, and the refused Debuts turned
them up a few at a time: every refusal stopped at its first failing step,
and in the third a crashing test fixture took the rest of its batch down
with it. Each fix cost a booking and a Debut of about eight minutes. After
the fourth, a single run of every step came back clean, and the fifth Debut
reused it and passed. Run after the first refusal, it would have saved most
of those rounds.

## Install
Nothing new: the promotion tool and its checks are
[promote](promote.md)'s.
