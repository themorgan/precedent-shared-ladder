## Rule
**"Update Vendors" is the phrase that asks for this**, and it authorizes the
whole sequence below without asking again -- the same standing-phrase
mechanism as [go-update](go-update.md), for the other operation a person
otherwise has to spell out every time. **It carries the merge too**: when the
sequence below is done, run [go-update](go-update.md)'s chain on what it
produced -- say the target branch out loud, commit, push, open the pull
request, merge -- without going back for a second authorization. That is step
12, and it is part of the phrase rather than a separate grant.

**The sequence is one command, since 2026-09-27.** From the consuming repo,
run the BestPractice clone's own copy -- never a vendored one:

    python3 ../BestPractice/tools/precedent_update.py --repo .

It does steps 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 10 in order, with no question in between,
and **makes any missing branch tier on origin** -- `staging` from
`pre-staging`, `pre-staging` from `staging`, both from `main` when neither
exists (Morgan, 2026-09-27, strength: decided) --
and ends with one of three outcomes. It stages what it wrote and deleted
first, so the deep check judges what the commit will hold. **DONE** (exit
0): nothing is left, so commit and go on to steps 11 and 12. **LEFT FOR YOU** (exit 1): the calls
that belong to this repo, each named with its file and its question -- work
them under the conflicted-file review below, then run it again. **FAILED**
(exit 2): a step could not run or the deep check is red, and nothing is
published. Steps 7 to 9 are still the session's, and so are 11 and 12. The
numbered steps below say what the command does and why; they are for
investigating, not a checklist to walk by hand. Where one of them and the
command disagree, the command is the current code, and the step is what
needs fixing ([spec/ONE_COMMAND_UPDATE_PLAN.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/spec/ONE_COMMAND_UPDATE_PLAN.md),
Morgan 2026-09-27, `strength: decided`: *"I love 3, let's do it"*).

**Booked runs it for you when anything is behind**
([go-update](go-update.md)): `python3 tools/precedent_merge_vendors.py`
commits a finished update as a commit of its own, or takes a run that left
calls or failed back whole and names why. Say "Update Vendors" yourself to
work through what a NOT TAKEN run listed.

**This does not lift the gate the chain already runs through**, and it does
not add one. Booked (`Go update`) publishes by the repository's usual conventions, and
those are what decide whether a push may happen at all. Step 6 below is the
landing branch's check, and it sits before the merge for that reason: a red check stops this merge exactly as it stops any
other. What the phrase removes is the second question, not the gate. So a
failing check is reported, with what failed, and nothing is published -- that
is the sequence working, not a refusal needing permission to stand.

**Every conflicted file is reviewed, never overwritten on sight.** An
update meets this repo's own changes in many places: a refusal to overwrite
a hand-edited file, a drift report, a merge conflict, a hand-written rule in
`AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` that an updated practice now touches. Each one
gets the same two questions before anything is resolved: **does the local
version conflict with what upstream now ships, and is it still needed?**

- **It says what upstream now says**: take upstream. The local copy is a
  duplicate, and a duplicate is the copy that goes stale.
- **It conflicts**: ask the person whether the difference is deliberate.
  If it is, keep it and record it where this repo's tools will see it next
  time (below). If not, take upstream; the rule in force wins.
- **It doesn't conflict and is still needed**, because it covers something
  upstream doesn't: keep it, and carry it into the new version rather than
  choosing one side wholesale.

**A committed local edit to a received file is reviewed by the command
itself** (since 2026-09-29,
[spec/LOCAL_EDITS_TO_RECEIVED_FILES_PLAN.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/spec/LOCAL_EDITS_TO_RECEIVED_FILES_PLAN.md)),
for an engine file in `tools/`, a hook or declared engine path the engine
manifest records, `process/upstream/`, and a section 0 catalogue that has its
own `CATALOGUE_SYNC.json`. It compares the
file as it was vendored, as this repo committed it, and as upstream has it
now: an edit upstream has not touched stays; one that merges cleanly with
upstream's change, and still compiles and passes this repo's own check
tests and its landing-tier check, is merged; one upstream changed on the same lines is replaced by
upstream's version, most likely the same bug fixed there, and the report
names the commit holding the local one and how to bring it back. A file
recorded under `kept_template_divergences` with a reason is never
replaced. Every one is listed under **LOCAL EDITS** in the report, in every
outcome, and the ones kept or merged are still local edits:
`python3 ../BestPractice/tools/precedent_local_edits.py send --repo . --why "..."`
carries them upstream as a branch. **An uncommitted edit still stops the
update, with nothing written.** CI workflows are still refused as before,
and go through the review below.

**`--force`, `record-ci` and "take theirs" come after this review, never
instead of it**; each one discards the local side in a single step. A
difference kept on purpose is recorded so the next update does not ask
again: a `diverged` or `declined` entry in `process/manifest.json` for a
file of the vendored catalogue, a `kept_template_divergences` entry in
`precedent.json` for `tools/bootstrap.sh`, an `AGENTS.md` section (step
10(d) says how), or a received file in `tools/` or `process/upstream/`
(keyed by its path, `template_sha256` set to upstream's current sha256), a
declared file under `local_ci_workflows` in a practice source's `precedent.json`, a repo-local
practice with `overrides:`, or a hand-written rule worded as an exception
to the practice it departs from. **The pull request lists every conflicted
file with its verdict** — kept, taken from upstream, or merged — and why.
Morgan, 2026-09-24: *"Every 'update vendors' should use that rule for every
conflicted file"* ([current-rule-governs](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/current-rule-governs.md) says
which side wins when the review finds a real conflict).

**Follow the upstream copy of this runbook, not the one vendored here.**
The copy in this repo is from the last sync, and every correction made to
the procedure since then is exactly what it lacks. Once step 1 has made the
source clone current, read `practices/vendor-update-runbook.md` in that
clone, on the branch this repo takes its updates from, and follow that
([current-rule-governs](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/current-rule-governs.md)). Incident, 2026-09-24: a
consumer followed its own old copy of these steps and missed a change to
them that had already been published.

A vendored tree is updated by a fixed sequence, in this order, because
every step's answer is wrong if the one before it was skipped.

**First, is this repo running the loader at all?** A classic install —
`process/upstream/` vendored, no universal source in `precedent.json`, no
generated block in `AGENTS.md` — is not updated, it is migrated, in the
same change:
[spec/MIGRATING_EXISTING_INSTALLS.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/spec/MIGRATING_EXISTING_INSTALLS.md).
`practice_audit.py`, `checkin.py update` and the session-start bootstrap all
say so when it is. An update that leaves the repo classic has refreshed text
that no session reads, which is how a consumer took one on 2026-09-23 and
still had nothing in force.

**The same goes for a repo that runs the loader but has no
`tools/ENGINE_MANIFEST.json`** — its engine sits only under
`process/upstream/tools/`, because the migration stopped before its step 7.
`refresh` cannot run there, so nothing in step 3 reaches it. Step 10(e) says
what to do; `practice_audit.py` fails on it (check 8) and `checkin.py update`
says so, both from the vendored tree under `process/upstream/`.

1. **Make the SOURCE clone current first, against the branch this repo is
   pinned to** — not the source's default branch. A stale source makes
   every later step confidently wrong: the diff is against the wrong
   lineage, and "already up to date" is the answer you get.

   **For BestPractice that branch is `main`, for every install**, since
   2026-09-25 -- the branch that has passed every local check and the
   GitHub test (Morgan, 2026-09-25, `strength: decided`: *"Yes, switch all
   installs to main. ... Let's do it, go ahead, go update"*). An install
   whose `process/manifest.json` records `"branch": "staging"` -- or
   `precedent-beta-v01`, staging's name until that morning -- is repointed
   to `main` in this same update, and so is its `tools/ENGINE_MANIFEST.json`.
   **Step 3's refresh writes both itself, since 2026-09-27: never edit the
   pin by hand, and never ask whether to.** It is already decided, and a
   hand edit to the file that says which branch a repo tracks is exactly
   what a harness permission check holds for a human -- which is how a
   consumer update stopped halfway that day, engine on `main` and catalogue
   on `precedent-beta-v01`, asking a question nobody needed to answer. A
   repo left in that half state is repointed by re-running step 3.

   The consequence to know: a change reaches your other repositories only
   once it is on BestPractice's main, which takes staging by a Promote or a
   pull request (no merge there has needed Alex's sign-off since
   2026-09-26, per [AGENTS.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/AGENTS.md)). For one day before that, 2026-09-24, installs had been
   split between `main` and `precedent-beta-v01` on an approval Morgan
   later called assent rather than a decision; this move was made for
   every install at once so that cannot happen again.

   **The two vendored layers do not both need this, and knowing which is
   which is the whole point of the step.** The ENGINE is read by blob out of
   a freshly fetched commit (see the pin note below), so the clone's checkout
   is irrelevant to it. The CATALOGUE is read from the clone's WORKING TREE —
   [tools/precedent_materialize.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/precedent_materialize.py) has no
   fetch call in it at all — so for that half, whatever is checked out *is*
   the input. Step 1 is not hygiene; it is the correctness argument for
   step 2.

   **It is done, then checked — an instruction alone was proven not to
   work.** `precedent_refresh_sources.py --apply` now brings each clone to
   its declared `base_branch` as its first action, verifies the working tree
   actually arrived there, and **refuses to report success when it could
   not**: a skipped source is named, and the run exits non-zero. Before
   2026-09-21 it printed `applied.` and exited 0 however many sources it had
   declined, and four of them drifted 17 to 34 commits behind while every
   session start reported success
   ([todo-2026-09-21-refresh-output-blocks-the-next-pull](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/todo/todo-2026-09-21-refresh-output-blocks-the-next-pull.md)).

   **Two things it deliberately does not do.** It never touches a modified
   file the clone's own `ENGINE_MANIFEST.json` does not list — the engine may
   discard its own output, never a person's edit — and it never repairs a
   clone carrying unpushed commits of its own. Both are reported and left
   alone: rebasing somebody's work to get a vendoring tool unstuck is the
   trade that made this loop in the first place.

   Morgan, 2026-09-21 (strength: decided): *"would this force it to clone the
   most updated version first thing? I think that's what we need."* A check
   that merely refused on a stale clone was the first proposal, and the
   measurement retired it — it would have fired on all four sources every
   session for weeks and changed nothing, because nothing in the sequence was
   ever going to make them current.

   **You do not have to name that branch, and you must not check it out.**
   The pin is compiled into the vendored tool as `SOURCE_BRANCH` in
   [tools/precedent_vendor_engine.py](../tools/precedent_vendor_engine.py),
   and `refresh` fetches it and reads `tools/` out of it **by blob** —
   `git show <commit>:tools/<file>` — so the clone's own `HEAD`, branch and
   working tree are never touched. A fresh clone satisfies this step; so
   does an existing clone, because the fetch is the tool's first move.

   **So do not preface this sequence with a `git switch` onto the pinned
   branch.** In a consuming repo that branch does not exist at all — the pin
   names a branch of the SOURCE, not of the repo being updated — and in a
   clone of the source it reintroduces exactly the behaviour that was taken
   out of the tool on purpose: the old code ran `git checkout` plus
   `git pull` in the clone, which moved a person off whatever branch they
   were on, and in CI moved the job's own workspace so that every later step
   silently ran against the pinned branch instead of the commit under test,
   with `git status` clean throughout. That cost several sessions on pull
   request #110, and `_source_tools_at`'s docstring carries the finding.
   Asked by Morgan, 2026-09-14 — *"Maybe it should even preface that command
   with `git switch precedent-beta-v01`"* — and answered no, for this reason.
2. **Read every vendored layer separately.** A repo usually vendors more
   than one — the loader *engine* and the practice *catalogue* are
   different trees with different manifests, and **they move
   independently**. Checking one and reporting "current" is the common
   failure.
3. **Refresh the engine, and take the branch tip.** Expect two passes when
   the tool replaces itself; the second is not a retry, it is the new copy
   running its own corrected file list.
   **Since 2026-09-15 this also refreshes `.claude/hooks/*.sh`**, drift-checked
   and tracked in the same `ENGINE_MANIFEST.json` as `tools/`
   (`hook_files`/`hooks_sha256`) — before that date the hook scripts were
   copied once at initial install and never refreshed again, so a fix
   landing in one (the `freshness-guard.sh` shallow-clone false-positive,
   `record/GOTCHAS.md#g12`, is the incident that prompted this) never
   reached an already-vendored repo no matter how many times "Update
   Vendors" ran. A repo vendored before this date has no `hook_files` in
   its manifest yet; its first refresh after taking this change prints a
   one-time catch-up notice and vendors all of them, even though the
   `tools/` commit may already match. **One time is the point: a second
   refresh at the same commit prints "nothing to do".** Until 2026-09-25 a
   hook a declared source's adapters own (`commit-identity.sh`,
   `freshness-guard.sh` from an individual source) was skipped, never
   recorded, and still counted as missing, so the notice repeated on every
   refresh and every engine file was rewritten; seeing it twice in a row now
   is a bug to report. `.claude/settings.json` is only ever **added to**,
   never edited: since 2026-09-25 the refresh adds the entries its kind's
   `HOOK_WIRING` lists and the repo lacks, and since 2026-10-02 it also
   gives `freshness-guard.sh` the branch in `precedent.json`'s
   `base_branch` when no existing entry names one. For a consumer, the same
   refresh writes and wires the individual-set bootstrap hook, first in
   `SessionStart`, when the person running it has an individual set (no
   repository URL is written into it), and merges
   `templates/gitignore.template` into `.gitignore`. A consumer's own hook
   wiring stays its own: decline any of these in `precedent.json`'s
   `declined_adapters` with the reason.
   **Since 2026-09-18 this also refreshes the installed CI workflow file(s)**
   vendored from `templates/github-actions/*.template` — a dependent repo's
   `.github/workflows/bestpractice-docs.yml` (from `doc-lint.yml.template`),
   a practice set's `.github/workflows/views-drift.yml` and
   `precedent-check.yml` (from their own templates) — drift-checked and
   tracked the same way, in the same `ENGINE_MANIFEST.json`
   (`ci_workflow_files`/`ci_workflows_sha256`). Before this date these files
   were written once, at initial install, and never refreshed: a template fix
   landing after install — the `concurrency:` block `doc-lint.yml.template`
   gained on 2026-09-15, then
   [spec/CI_MINUTES_PLAN.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/spec/CI_MINUTES_PLAN.md)'s
   Phase C debounce-guard step the very next day — reached an already-installed
   `bestpractice-docs.yml` only if that repo happened to reinstall from
   scratch. A repo vendored before this date has no `ci_workflows_sha256` in
   its manifest yet; its first refresh after taking this change records a
   baseline hash for whichever of these files it has installed and prints a
   one-time catch-up notice — but, **unlike the hooks catch-up above, does
   NOT rewrite the file's content on that first run.** A CI workflow is
   exactly the kind of file a real repo hand-tunes (an extra job, a changed
   schedule, a repo-specific secret), so overwriting an unrecorded one the
   first time this shipped would have discarded that with no warning. Run
   `refresh` again once the baseline is recorded to pick up template changes
   normally from then on.
   **Since 2026-09-27, in a consuming repo, none of that caution applies,
   and nothing is asked.** A consumer's CI converges to upstream: the
   refresh rewrites whichever of `leak-gate.yml` and `light-check.yml` is
   installed to the current template, tracked or not, hand-edited or not
   (an absent one stays absent), and
   removes every other workflow upstream does not ship, unless the person
   approved it in their own words in `github_ci_approved`. A declaration
   under `local_ci_workflows` no longer keeps one in a consumer. **Nothing
   needed is lost:** a file that runs anything the local push check does not
   run (a script, a test runner, a third-party action) is **left alone, and
   flagged loudly**: an `IMPORTANT -- GITHUB WORKFLOW LEFT ALONE` banner
   before and after the update's summary, a **Left for you** line naming
   what to move into the local check, and an open item in the repo's
   `todo/`. Tell the person, in the reply, in those words. The next update
   finishes it once the command runs locally. Each replacement
   and removal is printed as done; a file git does not hold, or one with
   uncommitted edits, is left under **Left for you** so its content is never
   lost. Morgan, 2026-09-27 (strength: decided): *"It should definitely
   definitely use the newer version from upstream ... so it shouldn't ask.
   Asking creates doubt and confusion when there isn't any."* The checks a
   removed workflow ran belong in the local push check, which runs before
   every push; the removal line names the scripts it ran. A practice source
   is unchanged by this.
   **Since 2026-09-24 it also refreshes any file the repo declares under
   `engine_paths` in its own `precedent.json`** — an upstream path mapped to
   a local one, for a file the repo must keep at a path of its own:
   `{"templates/harness/claude-code/hooks/commit-identity.sh":
   "bootstrap/commit-identity.sh"}` is precedent-individual's, which
   `session-start.sh` and that set's own `adapters` both reach by that path.
   Tracked in `ENGINE_MANIFEST.json` (`engine_paths`/`engine_paths_sha256`)
   and drift-checked like `tools/`. **A newly declared file is adopted only
   if it is already identical to upstream**; otherwise the refresh refuses,
   names how many lines differ, and `--force` does not waive it — move the
   difference upstream first. A mapping onto a path an adapter writes, or
   one this engine already vendors, is refused outright.
   **Since 2026-09-25 it also refreshes a consumer's `tools/bootstrap.sh`
   — but only while it carries no local edits.** Unedited means it matches
   the baseline hash `ENGINE_MANIFEST.json` records for it
   (`template_instances_sha256`), or, where nothing is recorded yet, it is
   byte-identical to some past version of upstream `templates/bootstrap.sh`.
   Either way it is rewritten to the current template. A copy with local
   edits is never rewritten, `--force` included: the refresh reports it
   `DIVERGED`, names each template block it lacks by line, and puts it on
   the **Left for you** list for step 10(d). Before this date nothing
   delivered a template change to an installed copy; a real consumer ran
   two days without the session-start freshness check for exactly that
   reason.
   **Since 2026-09-25 it also refreshes the sections `AGENTS.md` took from
   its template, on the same terms, one section at a time.** A section is a
   `##` or `###` heading and what follows it; the generated loader block is
   not one, and stays the sync's (step 5). An unedited section — matching
   the hash recorded under `agents_md_sections_sha256`, or with nothing
   recorded, identical to that section in some past version of the
   template — is rewritten to the current template. An edited one is never
   rewritten, `--force` included: it is reported `DIVERGED` with each
   bullet, paragraph or table row of the template's section it lacks, down
   to the missing sentences, and goes on **Left for you**. A section the
   template has and the file does not is reported `MISSING` once, and never
   written in. Before this date whatever the template wrote at install was
   frozen: a template fix reached no installed repo, and nothing said so.
   The same run lists every line of `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md` and
   `tools/bootstrap.sh` that still names a **retired branch**
   (`precedent-beta-v01`, renamed `staging` on 2026-09-25), outside the
   generated block. Nothing else outside `tools/`, `.claude/hooks/`, the CI
   workflows, `tools/bootstrap.sh` and those `AGENTS.md` sections is
   touched.
   **Since 2026-09-19, check whether this refresh newly vendors
   `tools/todo_migrate.py` or `tools/build_todo_index.py`** — the one-time
   per-item TODO migration tool and its ongoing index generator
   ([spec/OPEN_ITEM_AND_GOTCHA_PLAN.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/spec/OPEN_ITEM_AND_GOTCHA_PLAN.md)
   Part 4.2). Vendoring the tool is not the same as running it, and nothing
   else says so: this repo shipped both to every consumer on 2026-09-15/16
   and, once source sets turned out to need them too, to every source set
   on 2026-09-19 — and confirmed the same day that most consumers had
   never run it, three or more days after it arrived. If `TODO.md` is
   still the old single-file format (no `todo/` directory, no `# TODO has
   moved` stub heading), run `python3 tools/todo_migrate.py --source todo.md --apply` then
   `python3 tools/build_todo_index.py` as part of this refresh, not as a
   follow-up. Step 6's full check also catches this —
   [todo-migrate-available-but-unused](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/todo-migrate-available-but-unused.md)
   — but the fix belongs here, at the refresh that brought the tool in,
   not deferred to whoever next happens to run the check.
   **When the same update is going into more than one repo, note the tip
   before you start and check every repo against it at the end.** Each refresh
   resolves the tip at the moment it runs, so two repos updated an hour apart
   can land a commit apart with nobody having done anything wrong — a
   four-set rollout on 2026-09-14 ended exactly that way.
   **Close that gap by rolling the laggard FORWARD, never by holding the
   others back.** Level matters less than current: a repo pinned to an
   ancestor is missing whatever landed after it, and in that rollout the one
   set left behind was missing the reply gate the other three already had.
   Holding the others back would have made all four miss it and removed the
   very difference that made anyone look.
   `--from-ref <commit>` is for the two cases where an exact commit is the
   point — vendoring a commit whose diff you actually reviewed, and
   reproducing a bug against an older engine — never for making a rollout
   tidy.
4. **Take the catalogue update with `checkin.py update`.** Every install
   follows `main`, BestPractice's default branch, and step 3 has already
   repointed a retired pin, so the pin and the default agree and the
   pinned-branch hold does not fire. **Only a repo deliberately pinned to
   some other branch** takes the manual mirror instead
   ([spec/MIGRATING_EXISTING_INSTALLS.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/spec/MIGRATING_EXISTING_INSTALLS.md)'s
   "The default-branch gotcha"): a tool resolving the default there would
   mirror the wrong lineage over the pinned tree, a wholesale revert
   wearing an update's clothes. Until 2026-09-27 this step said "under a
   branch pin, the manual mirror" with no exception for `main`, which sent
   a consumer session looking for a route it did not need.

   **`checkin.py record`'s carry check reads the COMMITTED tree on the
   remote, not your working tree**, so restoring a file locally after a
   `record` and re-running changes nothing it sees: it lists
   `origin/<branch>` with `git ls-tree` and reads each file back with
   `git show origin/<branch>:<path>`. The "restore it and re-record" move is
   not a way around `--accept-loss`; it only works once the restore is
   itself committed and pushed. Reported from a dependent repo that hit it
   twice in one hop, 2026-09-21, and verified here against the tool's own
   git calls rather than taken on the report.

   **A line upstream deleted itself is never counted as lost**, since
   2026-09-26. Under the branch tiers your base branch takes the update by
   Promote, later, so its committed tree is often one sync behind the
   manifest; the check used to read every line upstream removed in between
   as dropped local work (301 of them on one consumer, none real). It now
   compares that tree against every upstream commit it could have come
   from, and sets aside what upstream's own history deleted, saying how
   many. **A `LOST` line it prints is a line upstream never had**: carry it
   or pass `--accept-loss` knowingly -- never hand-write `upstream.commit`
   to step around it
   ([gotcha](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/gotchas/gotcha-2026-09-26-the-carry-check-counted-upstream-s-own-deletions-as-lost.md)).

   **`record` and `status` read the source clone's COMMITTED tree too**,
   since 2026-09-27: `origin/<pinned branch>`, never the folder on disk.
   So a gitignored file a session-start hook wrote into that clone --
   `.claude/settings.local.json`, `.precedent/` -- can no longer fail
   them, and `push` never deletes a file git does not track there. **If
   `record` ever names one of those files, that is a bug to report, not a
   file to delete**: deleting it only lasts until the next session start
   writes it back.

   **Then decide every earlier decline again, in this same change.** Any
   upstream practice this repo once declined or deferred ("a duplicate of
   our own rule", "not now") was declined as its text stood *then*. For each
   one, read the current upstream file and decide again: adopt it, or keep
   declining it with a reason that fits the current text. A decline that
   lives only in prose (a sync note, a paragraph in `AGENTS.md`) goes into
   the manifest as a `declined` entry
   ([INSTALL.md §5](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/INSTALL.md#5-the-manifest-schema-processmanifestjson)),
   so the next sync does not depend on somebody remembering it. Any other
   hand-written rule an updated practice now touches gets the
   conflicted-file review at the top of this runbook.
   `checkin.py update` lists the declines this update has moved past, and
   `practice_audit.py` fails on them at step 6 until each is decided again
   ([current-rule-governs](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/current-rule-governs.md)). Incident, 2026-09-24:
   a dependent repo declined upstream's merge-keyword practice as a
   duplicate of a personal rule. Upstream replaced it with a broader one,
   two later syncs carried the old decline forward without reading it, and
   a session refused a command the rule in force authorized.
5. **Regenerate the generated views in the same change.** A refreshed
   generator whose output has not been re-run leaves the repo's committed
   views describing the old engine, and its own `--check` then fails on
   work that is otherwise correct. The bump and its output land together.
6. **Run this repo's own check at the tier of the branch it lands on**, not
   the upstream's -- the one command does, with `--push-command`. Into
   pre-staging that is the fast checks on what the update changed; **the
   full check runs at the Promote to staging, not here** (Morgan,
   2026-09-27, strength: decided: *"The point of pre-staging is to move
   fast, so I want the 10 minute checks to happen at the staging level,
   not pre-staging"*; practice
   [checks-follow-the-tier](checks-follow-the-tier.md)). This step used to
   ask for the full check by hand, after a regenerated AGENTS.md went out
   on 2026-09-25 with its version header unbumped; the commit now stamps
   that header, and pre-staging's own checks refuse stale views.
7. **Check that this environment can still reach its PRIVATE sources**,
   before you call the update done. A vendor update is when a new engine
   file arrives that the environment may not be configured for, and it is
   the one moment somebody is looking at how this repo gets its practices
   at all. Run
   [tools/precedent_source_credentials.py](../tools/precedent_source_credentials.py);
   `MISSING` means a source is absent and no credential is set, so the
   session is running on the universal catalogue alone and nothing else
   will say so.
8. **Check that every source repository is still CALLED what this repo
   calls it** — *in a repo that declares sources.* A renamed repository
   redirects indefinitely, so the clone, the fetch and the materialize all
   keep succeeding under the old name and nothing anywhere fails. This is
   the one moment a session is already online and already reconciling its
   sources, so it is where the question gets asked. Run
   [tools/precedent_source_names.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/precedent_source_names.py);
   `UNVERIFIED` means the name was not checked, which is not the same as
   checked and current.
   **In a hosted session, attach each source with access "push" before
   this step**, public shared sets included. The session's proxy answers
   GitHub's API only for attached repositories, and read access does not
   attach a public one, because git can already read it. git follows a
   rename silently, so it cannot answer this either. Reading practices
   needs only read access; checking the name is the one reason for push
   here (measured 2026-09-28 and 2026-09-30: every public set
   `UNVERIFIED` until attached with push).
   **If that attach is refused, take the name from `list_repos` instead,
   and never route around the refusal.** Claude Code's auto-mode
   classifier can refuse a push attach as a permission grant (2 of 3,
   2026-09-30). `list_repos` gives each repository's `full_name` as GitHub
   calls it now, so pass the ones for your sources:
   `--canonical OWNER/NAME`, once per source. A source the list carries
   exactly reads `OK`. One the list does not carry stays `UNVERIFIED`, and
   you report it that way: it may have been renamed, or be out of the
   account's reach.

   **In a practice SET this step is not applicable, and that is different
   from skipped.** The tool reads a multi-source config a set does not
   have, so it is in `CONSUMER_ENGINE_FILES` only and is deliberately not
   vendored into a set at all — a session following this runbook there
   finds no such file. Say "not applicable: this repo declares no sources"
   and move on. Do not go looking for the file, and do not report a step
   you could not run as one you skipped. Step 7 above is **not** in this
   position and still applies everywhere: `precedent_source_credentials.py`
   is in the shared `ENGINE_FILES`, because a session rooted in a practice
   set needs the person's own individual set exactly as much as a consumer
   does.
   **Read both tools' answers as answers about THIS repo, and check that
   they are.** Until 2026-09-14 they were not, on the commonest consuming
   layout of all: an engine vendored at `process/upstream/tools/` defaulted
   its root to the vendored tree, which carries a `precedent.json` of its
   own, so step 7 named three declared shared sources as missing at paths
   nothing had ever written to, and step 8 left the same three
   `UNVERIFIED`. Both readings were specific enough to be believed and both
   were about the wrong repository. Fixed at the root rather than in the
   runbook — `consuming_repo_root()` in
   [tools/precedent_source_credentials.py](../tools/precedent_source_credentials.py)
   — so these steps need no `--repo` and no caveat. **If either step names a
   path inside `process/`, the engine copy you are running predates that
   fix: pass `--repo .` and take the answer from that run.**

9. **Check whether a source should be added or dropped — yourself, and
   raise only a concrete finding.** Steps 7 and 8 both ask about the
   sources this repo already declares — can they be reached, are they
   still called that. Neither can ask the question underneath: *should
   this repo be declaring something it isn't?* **A set that was never
   declared is invisible.** It produces no `MISSING`, no `UNVERIFIED`, no
   error and no absent file — only a repo quietly resolving fewer
   practices than its owner believes, and no check will ever report it,
   because **the sets a repo COULD declare are not derivable from the sets
   it does.**

   So the session looks, and an update is when: somebody is already
   looking at how this repo gets its practices. List the practice sets
   this account can reach (in a hosted Claude Code session, `list_repos`;
   elsewhere, the account's repositories or the clones beside this one),
   read each one's subject in its `precedent-source.json`, and compare
   them with what `precedent.json` declares. **Never put it to the person
   as an open question** — "should any source be added or dropped?" is
   the question [the-boildown](the-boildown.md) forbids (Morgan,
   2026-09-28, strength: decided). Nothing found is said in one line.
   Something found is a finding with a recommendation: *"precedent-shared-X
   is not declared here; its subject is Y, which this repo does — declare
   it?"*, or a declared set whose subject this repo no longer has. Do not
   skip the look because nothing looks wrong — nothing looking wrong is
   the symptom, not the all-clear.

   Measured, 2026-09-09, across five repositories that each looked healthy:
   one had no session-start instruction at all, so nothing ever fetched the
   sources its config named; one had never declared `visibility`, and an
   absent field counts as public, which silently excluded every
   private-level source from its generated views; and three named their
   sources in hand-written prose that went stale the day a shared set was
   split by subject. **Not one produced a failing check.**

   **Once the answer changes what this repo declares, grep before moving
   on.** Run `grep -n '<name>' AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md` for every source name
   now declared, one name at a time. A hit outside a dated Story, gotcha,
   or incident write-up is a standing enumeration of the declared sources
   sitting in hand-authored prose — the same staleness risk this whole step
   exists to catch, one level down. Reword it to describe the set
   dynamically (a count, or a pointer to `precedent.json`) rather than
   naming it.

10. **Retire legacy leftovers — on every update, not only after a
    migration.** Whatever the old, pre-Precedent install left behind goes in
    this update: Morgan, 2026-09-24 (strength: decided), *"this needs to be
    deleted from ALL installs, the migration to the new precedent should
    [have] deleted this."* This step is how that reaches every install
    without anyone remembering a sweep. Do all of it:

    **(a) Read the end of step 3's refresh output.** The refresh already
    deleted what it could recognise: a leftover workflow whose CONTENT has
    the old install's shape (`bestpractice-upstream-sync.yml`,
    `bestpractice-docs.yml`, `views-drift.yml`), tracked or not, hand-paused
    or not; a retired hook nothing calls; and `ci_debounce_minutes` in
    `precedent.json` or `identity.json`. Each deletion is staged and
    recorded in `process/decommissioned_paths.json`. What it would not do is
    under **Left for you** at the very end.

    **(b) Work that list, item by item.** Read each kept file, hook or
    field. Then either delete it with
    `python3 tools/precedent_decommission.py PATH --reason "..." --apply`,
    or record why it stays: in a practice source, a CI workflow under
    `local_ci_workflows` in `precedent.json` with its reason (a consumer
    keeps a workflow only by the person's approval); anything else in the
    pull request.
    **Never by name alone.** In a consumer the refresh has already settled
    every workflow (step 3), so what is left here is a file it could not
    safely touch. In a practice source, `light-check.yml` and a set's own
    workflows are live checks, not leftovers; the 2026-09-20 sweep deleted
    nine live checks by trusting names
    ([spec/CI_MINUTES_PLAN.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/spec/CI_MINUTES_PLAN.md)
    item 14). A live one is paused first and decommissioned a cycle later,
    as [tools/precedent_decommission.py](../tools/precedent_decommission.py)
    requires.

    **(c) Fix stale source paths.** Each source in `precedent.json` whose
    path is not its current name gets both corrected — the practice sets
    were renamed `precedent-team-*` → `precedent-shared-*`. Since
    2026-09-28 the refresh makes that repoint itself (name, path, and level
    `team` → `shared`) and says so; it lists only a set whose clone still
    sits at the old path with nothing at the new one, which you clone or
    move before running it again, and any other mismatch. GitHub redirects
    the old name, so nothing fails: the repo just clones the same set
    twice, or not at all. Run step 8's tool afterwards.

    **(d) Bring diverged template-written text up to the template:
    `tools/bootstrap.sh`, `AGENTS.md`'s sections, and retired branch
    names.** For `tools/bootstrap.sh`: the
    refresh already rewrote an unedited copy (step 3). One it reported
    `DIVERGED` has local edits, and the output lists each block of upstream
    `templates/bootstrap.sh` it lacks, as `templates/bootstrap.sh:LINE
    "heading" -- missing` or `-- N of its M lines absent or changed`.
    **Move this repo's own steps into `tools/bootstrap.local.sh`** (since
    2026-09-30), which the template runs just before its final `exit 0`
    and refresh never touches; then copy the template back over
    `tools/bootstrap.sh`, so it is unedited and the next refresh keeps it
    current. Only where that cannot work, copy each listed block in by
    hand, keeping every line this repo added, then re-run step 3's
    refresh: it should report the file as carrying every block. **The
    report also names any lines after a top-level `exit`:** those never
    run, which is how a hand merge silently dropped a consumer's own
    steps. Move them into the local file. Never replace the whole file to get there, and
    never reach for `--force`, which does not touch it anyway. **The one
    exception is the old install's wrapper**, a `tools/bootstrap.sh` that
    only runs `process/upstream/tools/bootstrap.sh` — BestPractice's own
    session bootstrap, not the template, so it runs the wrong script. Since
    2026-09-28 the refresh recognises one that carries nothing else and
    replaces it with the template itself, saying `REPLACED`. One with lines
    of its own is reported with a note saying so: replace it with
    `templates/bootstrap.sh` by hand and carry those lines in.

    **A difference kept on purpose is recorded, not re-decided every
    update** (since 2026-09-28). When the person confirms a reported
    `tools/bootstrap.sh` or `AGENTS.md` section is worded this repo's way
    deliberately, add it to `precedent.json` under
    `kept_template_divergences`, keyed exactly as the report names it —
    `tools/bootstrap.sh`, or `AGENTS.md` and a space and the heading line —
    with the reason and the `template_sha256` the report prints under the
    item:

    ```json
    "kept_template_divergences": {
      "AGENTS.md ### Session start": {
        "reason": "we start sessions our own way; see the section",
        "template_sha256": "<the hash the refresh printed>"
      }
    }
    ```

    From then on the refresh prints one `KEPT ON PURPOSE` line with the
    reason, leaves it off **Left for you**, and `precedent_update.py` can
    end DONE. The hash pins the decision to the template text it was made
    against: when upstream changes that text, the item is listed again in
    full, with the new hash to record if it is still kept. An entry with no
    reason is not honoured. A `diverged` entry in `process/manifest.json`
    does not do this — that manifest tracks the vendored catalogue, and
    nothing that reads it looks at these files.

    **For each `AGENTS.md` section reported `DIVERGED`**, the output names
    the template line of each block the section lacks, and under a block it
    has only part of, each sentence it lacks. Read each against what the
    section already says. Where the repo says the same thing in its own
    words, leave it — the report compares text, not meaning, so a local
    rewrite of a template sentence always lists that sentence. Where it
    does not, copy the template's text in, fill its `<placeholders>` with
    this repo's real names, and keep every line the repo added. A section
    reported `MISSING`: copy it in where it belongs if it applies here, or
    leave it out and say so in the reply — the next refresh notes it in one
    line and stops listing it. **Each retired branch name** the run lists:
    change it to the new name on that line, unless the line records the
    rename on purpose, in which case name the new branch on the same line
    and the report stops listing it. Upstream keeps the old name working as
    an alias until no refresh reports one, so this is not an emergency, and
    it is how the alias gets to retire. The run never lists a line inside
    the generated block, because the sync rewrites it. If one still names a
    retired branch after step 5's regeneration, the text came from a practice, and
    `precedent_check.py --only retired-branch-name-ships`, run in the set
    that publishes it, names the practice to fix there.

    **In the same file, remove a hardcoded git identity.** A literal
    `git config user.name` or `user.email` in `tools/bootstrap.sh` or
    `.claude/settings.json` names a person in a shared template; the
    refresh lists each one under **Left for you**. Delete just those lines,
    keeping the rest of the file. `commit-identity.sh` resolves who
    is committing. **A fallback branch is not an exception.** One that
    names a person "only when the individual source has not resolved yet"
    was tested 2026-09-25 on a scratch consumer with no individual source:
    `commit-identity.sh` already set the right author from
    `PRECEDENT_COMMIT_*` or the authenticated GitHub account; with neither,
    its backstop refused the bot-authored commit rather than letting it
    through; and with a second person's identity declared, the fallback
    overwrote it with the named one.

    **(e) Finish an unfinished migration.** No `tools/ENGINE_MANIFEST.json`
    means (a) could not run at all. Say so out loud, confirm with the person
    that this update will finish the migration — it is bigger than an
    update — then do
    [spec/MIGRATING_EXISTING_INSTALLS.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/spec/MIGRATING_EXISTING_INSTALLS.md)
    from step 7 on, which seeds the engine at `tools/`. Then run step 3's
    refresh and continue from (a). If the person says not now, stop before
    publishing: step 6 fails until it is done.

    **(f) File the secrets only the person can delete.** List every
    repository secret no remaining workflow reads. The refresh names the
    ones it can see: what a deleted workflow read (the Claude keys, once the
    upstream sync is gone) and `PERSONAL_PACK_TOKEN`. Write **one** `todo/`
    item for the person listing them all, with `disposition: ask` and
    `remind_on` set to today, and where to delete them (Settings → Secrets
    and variables → Actions). A session cannot delete a secret; never say it
    did.

    **(g) Get the person's approval for every workflow file that stays.**
    Run `python3 tools/precedent_check.py --only ci-workflow-approved`.
    **In a consuming repo this should already be clean:** step 3 replaced
    the engine's workflows with the templates and removed every other one
    nobody approved, without asking. A file it still names is one the
    refresh left under **Left for you** (untracked, or uncommitted edits):
    commit or discard the edit and refresh again. Do not ask the person
    about it. **In a practice source**, every file it names bills at least a
    minute per run in a private repo, and nobody has approved it as it
    stands. For each one, show the person
    what it runs and **when it triggers**, in one line, and ask. Record the
    answer in `precedent.json`'s `github_ci_approved`, pinned to the file's
    sha256 and quoting their words, or delete the file. **Never approve one
    on the person's behalf**, and never "fix" a trigger to make it pass
    without asking
    ([ci-workflow-approved](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/ci-workflow-approved.md), Morgan, 2026-09-25:
    "In the migration and updates, can we put a check explicitly for
    this?"). Until every file passes, step 6 fails and so does every push.

    **The update only changes the branch it lands on**, so a side branch
    keeps whatever workflow files it had. That matters only for an active
    one: a branch runs a workflow when it is pushed, and a stale branch
    nobody pushes runs nothing. Run `python3 tools/ci_fleet_audit.py --repo
    OWNER/NAME` for this repo. It reads only side branches with a commit in
    the last 7 days and names any whose workflow would run on its next
    push. For each one, say whether the branch holds anything unmerged, and
    hand the person its one-click link to delete it
    ([never-delete-a-remote-branch](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/never-delete-a-remote-branch.md)).

    **(h) Give the repo all three branches.** Run
    `python3 tools/precedent_branches.py --ensure-tiers`. It says whether
    origin has `pre-staging` and a `staging` branch of its own; if either is
    missing, run it again with `--apply`, which creates them and, in a repo
    whose staging tier was `main`, writes `"staging_branch": "staging"` into
    `precedent.json` for this update to commit. `base_branch` stays as it
    is, because it also pins where a practice source's session clone sits.
    From then on work lands on pre-staging, Promote moves it to staging,
    and main takes staging by pull request. Morgan, 2026-09-25: *"make sure
    that all repos with precedent vendored-in have staging and pre-staging
    branches? That should be part of the migration!"*

    **(i) Fix this repo's citations of anything the update withdrew or
    reworded.** Run `python3 tools/precedent_practice_refs.py --withdrawn
    --changed-since HEAD --staged` (the one command runs it for you and
    reports it as `citations`). Each `MUST FIX` line is a link, lookup or
    Rule mention in this repo's own files naming a practice no longer in
    force: repoint it to the practice the tool names, or say in prose what
    it covered. Each `read` line cites a practice whose Rule this update
    reworded under the same name: read it, and fix it if it now describes
    the old rule. Citations inside files this repo received -- another
    source's practices, the vendored engine -- are that source's to fix, and
    the tool leaves them out
    ([practice-change-propagates](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/practice-change-propagates.md)).

    **(j) Report all of it in the reply**: what the refresh deleted, what
    you deleted, what stays and why, each workflow's approval, the branches
    step (h) created, the citations step (i) fixed, and the todo item.

    While here, check `github_ci_workflows` (formerly `ci_workflows`)
    ([GITHUB_ACTIONS.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/documentation/GITHUB_ACTIONS.md))
    is set the way the person actually wants, not just inherited from
    whatever an earlier install or migration left.
11. **Verify by content on the remote**, never by ref equality
   ([verify-postcondition](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/verify-postcondition.md)), **and before the merge
   in step 12, on the pushed branch or the pull request's head.** What
   merges is that head, so its content is the check that matters, and it
   runs before anything Claude Code's own safety check can refuse: on
   2026-10-01 the merge went through and the very next command, a read of
   the merged branch, was blocked as "Merge Without Review", so a check
   left for after the merge never ran
   ([gotcha](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/gotchas/gotcha-2026-10-01-auto-mode-blocks-the-read-after-update-vendors-merges-its-own.md)).
12. **Publish it, without asking again.** Run [go-update](go-update.md)'s
    chain on the result and report which branch it landed on. The phrase
    authorizes this step; do not stop after step 11 and ask. Every condition
    Booked (`Go update`) carries still holds -- a branch the repository restricts is
    still restricted, and a step this session cannot reach hands off rather
    than coming back as a question. **If the safety check refuses a step
    here, report that step by name and stop; never route around it.**
    Claude Code's auto mode refuses this merge as "Merge Without Review"
    even though the phrase authorizes it (2026-10-01). Say in one line
    that auto mode stopped it, not this repository's rules, and ask for
    it again in words that name it: "Merge PR #N into pre-staging".

**A refusal naming a file that no longer exists upstream means reseed, not
investigate.** The refresh runs *this repo's own vendored copy* of the
vendoring tool, which carries the file list it was vendored with — so the
first refresh after upstream renames or drops an engine file asks for a
path that is genuinely gone.

## Detail
**Step 1 is first because it is the one nobody thinks of as part of the
update.** The instinct is to start with the command that does the
vendoring. Every failure mode below step 1 is silent — no error, just an
answer computed against the wrong tree.

**On what "up to date" means for the source clone.** Fetch the pinned
branch by name. A clone can be current on its default branch and many
commits behind the branch that actually matters, and a shallow clone will
report divergence that does not exist — deepen before believing any
comparison.

**Never hand-edit a vendored file to resolve a merge.** The vendored tree
is not this repo's to change: restore it to what the manifest records and
re-run the refresh. An uncommitted hand edit is refused, a hook or CI
workflow edit is refused as drift, and `--force` is the wrong answer to
either refusal — it discards the guard rather than the edit.

**Port a change between a vendored copy and its upstream with a
three-way merge, never a file copy** — `precedent_local_edits.py send` does
exactly this for the consumer-to-upstream direction. Copying the consumer's file over
the upstream's deletes whatever the upstream gained since the last sync,
and nothing reports it. The merge base is **the consumer's last-synced
copy** — the upstream file the vendored one was taken from — not whatever
common commit git offers; the wrong base reports conflicts that are not
there and hides ones that are. Read the conflict count before using the
result, and never ship a file that still holds a conflict marker.

## Why
An update is not one operation, it is a small pipeline where each stage
consumes the last stage's output. Run out of order it does not fail, it
produces a confident, wrong result — and a vendored tree that is silently
wrong is worse than one that is obviously stale, because nothing will
prompt anyone to look again.

## Story
**The phrase was chosen 2026-09-08**, by Morgan, in the same conversation
that moved `go-merge` and `park-it` up to universal: *"Let's use the phrase
'Update Vendors' to trigger vendor-update-runbook."* It is plural on
purpose -- a repo usually vendors more than one layer, and the step people
skip is the second one.

**Amended 2026-09-14, on Morgan's instruction**, to carry the merge:
*"Also Update the definition of \"update vendors\" to include invoking go
merge."* The sentence it replaced had said the opposite in as many words --
that the phrase authorized the update and never the merge of what the update
produced. **Strength:** decided (2026-09-14, Morgan)

The original split was defensible and cost a step every time: an update that
stops at a verified, unpushed tree is a job half-finished, and the person who
typed one phrase to avoid being asked a question got asked one anyway, at the
end, about work that was already done and already checked. **What the split
was protecting is still protected, by the thing that was actually doing it:**
step 6's full check, which runs before anything is published and is what a
`Go update` here would have run into regardless. Removing the sentence removes
a second authorization, not a gate.

**Asked for by Morgan, 2026-09-08**, after watching a session do this from
memory across four repositories: *"maybe we define another phrase ... with
the general instructions on how to update the vendored in files? (Starting
with make sure your local copy of your main repo is up to date etc)."*

Every step here is a failure somebody already paid for. A consumer went
**167 commits behind** with the practice meant to catch it never firing,
because a branch pin had disabled both of its delivery paths for the same
honest-looking reason and neither knew about the other. A different repo
was told "up to date" by a check that only ever compared generated files
against declared sources — a real check, answering a different question
than the one being asked of it. A sync tool that resolved the remote's
default branch would have mirrored `main` over a beta-pinned tree. And on
the day this practice was written, three practice sets could not refresh at
all: upstream had renamed an engine file, and each set's own vendored copy
of the vendoring tool still asked for the old path.

**Step 8 is a failure that never failed.** A team source was renamed on
GitHub, and a consuming repo went on declaring, cloning, attaching and
materializing under the old name with every check green, for an unknown
number of sessions -- because GitHub redirects a renamed repository
indefinitely. It surfaced on 2026-09-11 only because a person recognised a
name he had retired. The content was right the whole time; the name was a
ghost, and every vendored reference to it was one repository-settings change
away from a 404 nobody could date.

**Step 8 then sent three sessions hunting for a file that was never there.**
Written with no caveat, it named `tools/precedent_source_names.py` as
something to run, and that file is in `CONSUMER_ENGINE_FILES` only -- by a
deliberate decision recorded in `precedent_vendor_engine.py`'s own comment,
because it reads a multi-source config a practice SET does not have. So in a
set the step is unrunnable by design, and on 2026-09-13 three sessions
following this runbook in one hit it: each was left choosing between
reporting a step it had skipped and searching for a missing engine file,
and a missing file reads like a broken vendoring, which is the expensive
direction to guess. The scoping clause is the whole fix. **A runbook step
that names a tool has to say where that tool exists**, because the session
reading it has no other way to tell "not for this repo" from "your install
is broken" -- the two look identical from a shell.

**Step 10 used to be a sweep a person ran by hand, and it never ran.**
Until 2026-09-24 it pointed at a table in the migration document and said
which leftovers still mattered; every install that migrated before the table
existed was expected to come back and apply it. Measured that day in six
installs: `bestpractice-docs.yml`, retired three days earlier, was still in
all five that had it, and `bestpractice-upstream-sync.yml` in four. The
removers only deleted what a manifest had recorded, and the oldest installs
had recorded nothing. The table's own first row also kept the upstream sync
on purpose, "so a person can still run it by hand", after the hold that
reason served had ended on 2026-09-14. Morgan reversed that the same day and
asked for the cleanup to run on every update instead. The refresh now
recognises the old files by content, and this step makes the session finish
what the code will not.

**The phrase this began as is deliberately not here.** A keyword is one
person's preference, and a universal rule telling every adopting repository
to go invent a keyword of its own is exactly what got
`merge-authorization-keyword` retired on 2026-09-07. The procedure is
universal; the word that triggers it belongs in an individual set.

Copied into this set on 2026-10-02 under the same slug, when the ladder became a set a person brings (spec/LADDER_OPT_IN_PLAN.md in BestPractice). For a person who brings this set it replaces the universal rule of the same name, so they read it in the ladder's words exactly as before; everyone else reads the universal copy, which says the same thing without them. Edit both.

## Install
Before starting, name the layers this repo vendors and where each records
its provenance — usually a manifest per layer. If you cannot name them, you
cannot tell whether the update is complete, and step 2 is the step that
most often gets skipped.

Then run the sequence above, and report which layers moved and which did
not. "Updated" without naming the layers is the report that hides half a
job.

**Step 8 is the one nobody can discover from a failure**, because there is
never a failure to discover it from. Only the GitHub API answers it: it
carries the repository's current `full_name` in the response body, so a name
that has moved shows up as a mismatch against what this repo declares. Every
git operation follows the redirect silently and reports success.

Step 7 runs itself: [tools/precedent_vendor_engine.py](../tools/precedent_vendor_engine.py)
prints the same line after a `refresh` or a `status`, so an update made
without reading this file still surfaces a source nobody can reach
(practice: checkable-gets-checked). Asked for by Morgan, 2026-09-09, in the
thread that found a whole session running with no shared or individual
practices in force and no error anywhere.
