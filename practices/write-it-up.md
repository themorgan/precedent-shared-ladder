## Rule
**"Write it up" is the clean form, not the only one** -- "put together a
writeup on this", "document what happened here for whoever picks this up",
and anything else that plainly asks for the same thing get the same
treatment. When a person asks for it, about whatever issue, bug, or
situation is currently in front of the session:

1. Write a report **assuming its reader is a different session or person
   who was not in this conversation** -- so it states, in full, plainly:
   - what the situation or issue is;
   - the context and the sequence of events that led to it;
   - **the analysis, done before any fix is written down as the proposal**:
     the situation and the possible solutions, weighed against each other.
     Once one idea looks right, **attack it** -- look for holes, failure
     cases, what it breaks and what it fails to cover -- then revise and
     improve it, and attack the revision the same way until it holds. The
     report records that work: the options considered, the holes found, and
     how the proposal answers each one;
   - the proposed solution -- the idea that survived the analysis, not the
     first one that came to mind.
   - **when the proposed solution would itself change something this repo
     ships to other repos** -- a practice file, a template, a hook, a
     vendored engine file, the same scope
     [vendor-rollout-disclosed](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/vendor-rollout-disclosed.md) already names
     -- the original template or mechanism in the upstream repo that
     organizes those other repos, not just the symptom in the repo the
     report was written in, and whether the fix needs a clean rollout
     through an updated template and
     [vendor-update-runbook](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/vendor-update-runbook.md)'s mechanism to reach
     them, when that's relevant.

   Put in everything that reader would need and nothing they'd have to ask
   a second time for. This is the opposite of a terse summary: completeness
   is the point, not brevity.
2. Commit that report as a file into the repository and branch the session
   is currently working in -- never a separate report-tracking repo -- in
   the repository's **write-up directory**: `writeup_dir` in its
   `precedent.json`, **`spec/` when the key is absent**, unless the person
   names another place for this one. Push it there.
3. Give the person the link to the committed file on that branch.
4. **When the proposed solution needs a repository this session cannot
   reach, or plainly belongs in a different session**, say so in the reply
   itself, separate from the committed report and not fenced: which
   repository has to be the primary seed root for that session, and which
   others, if any, need to be attached alongside it -- *"Open a new
   session, root it in \<repository\>, attaching \<repositories, or
   'none'\>."* The report is the durable record; this sentence is what
   gets the person moving on it now.

## Detail
**Where the file goes, in order:** the place the person names for this
write-up; else the repository's declared `writeup_dir` in `precedent.json`;
else `spec/`. That default is applied, not asked about
([declared-default-is-applied](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/declared-default-is-applied.md)), and the
directory is created if it does not exist yet. Name the file for the issue,
not for the date or for "report" --
[no-version-suffix](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/no-version-suffix.md) -- and in the word separator that
directory already uses ([filename-separator](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/filename-separator.md)).

**Declare a different `writeup_dir` when `spec/` already means something
else in the repository.** The common case is a Ruby project, where `spec/`
holds the RSpec test suite: a report there would not break the tests, but
it would sit among them where nobody looks for prose. The same goes for any
repo whose `spec/` holds generated or machine-read files. One line in
`precedent.json` (`"writeup_dir": "docs/writeups"`, say) settles it for
every later write-up in that repository.

**Why a declared directory rather than "wherever write-ups already live".**
Any session in any repository running this layer can write these, and many
will. Without one declared place they land wherever each session guesses,
and the next reader has to search for them. `spec/` is the default because
it is where this repository already keeps plans, briefs and analyses, which
are the documents a write-up most resembles.

**The push is part of the command, not a separate ask.** "Write it up"
authorizes committing and pushing the report to the branch already in use,
the same way [go-update](go-update.md) authorizes its own chain -- the person
should not have to be asked a second time whether the file they just asked
for should actually be saved. It does **not** by itself authorize opening a
pull request or merging anything; where the branch reaches its target only
through a reviewed PR, the report sits on the branch, pushed, linked, and
waiting there like any other commit, unless the person separately says
[go-update](go-update.md) or names the same intent.

**The report is the deliverable, not a chat summary of it.** A reply that
describes what the report says instead of linking to the committed file has
not done this.

**Where this differs from [Prompt Please](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/prompt-please.md).** That command
is smaller and never committed -- a paste-ready prompt for a new session,
built around a recommendation rather than a durable record. Reach for
`Write it up` when the issue needs a file that outlives this conversation;
reach for `Prompt Please` when all that's needed is to hand the next step to
a session that can act on it now. Nothing stops using both on the same
issue: write it up for the record, then ask for `Prompt Please` to actually
carry the next step elsewhere.

## Why
The whole reason to ask for this is to hand a problem to someone (or some
session) who wasn't there for the conversation that found it -- so the
report has to stand on its own. A chat reply doesn't survive past its
thread ([repo-is-memory](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/repo-is-memory.md)); a file on the branch does,
and is the thing that can actually be handed off or pointed at.

## Story
Coined by Morgan, 2026-09-18: a standing phrase for something he was typing
out in full each time -- write up the bug/issue with its context and a
proposed fix, assuming zero shared context, commit it, and give the link --
rather than re-describing the request whenever he needed it.

**Cross-referenced against [Prompt Please](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/prompt-please.md), 2026-09-20**,
when Morgan coined that command and drew the boundary himself: this command
is bigger and formally committed to GitHub; `Prompt Please` is smaller, and
just a prompt.

**Extended the same day**, on Morgan's instruction to this practice,
[My options](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/my-options.md) and [Prompt Please](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/prompt-please.md)
together: *"Any change that would effect other repos must take into
account the original templates in the mother system that organizes the
other repos, and must be rolled out cleanly in updated templates/migrations
to the others (if relevant)."* BestPractice is that mother system for
every repo it vendors this layer to, so this stays in the same
repo-agnostic form [vendor-rollout-disclosed](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/vendor-rollout-disclosed.md)
already fixed on -- "the repos vendoring this one," not the repo's own
name -- so it still reads correctly once vendored into one of them.
Strength: decided.

**Extended again the same day**, on the same instruction to all three
commands -- full quote in [Prompt Please](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/prompt-please.md)'s Story, where
the gap actually surfaced. `Write it up`'s own deliverable stays on this
branch, but its proposed solution can still point at work that belongs
elsewhere, and that routing was missing here the same way it was missing
from the other two. Strength: decided.

**Extended 2026-09-26**, on Morgan's instruction, in two parts. First, the
analysis step: after the events and before the fix, *"tell it to analyze
the situation and possible solutions including, once you have an idea, to
find holes and problems in it, to revise and improve the idea -- before you
even put it into the document to propose it."* Strength: decided. Second,
where the file goes, which the rule had left to each session's guess:
*"I like a folder like spec/ ... maybe that should be a standard we use to
put them in a spec/ directory, unless directed otherwise? Maybe this is a
variable defined in the repo, that is set to spec/ by default?"* -- asked as
a question, answered by the session recommending exactly that, and approved
with "Go update" in the same message. Strength: decided. Attacking the
default before it landed turned up one hole: in a Ruby project `spec/` is
the test suite, which is why the Detail tells such a repo to declare its own
`writeup_dir` rather than live with the default. The report now records its
own analysis, not only the result of it, because a reader who was not there
cannot trust a proposal whose alternatives they never see.

## Install
No mechanical check: like [go-update](go-update.md), whether a given reply
correctly recognized the request is a judgment about the conversation, not
a property a script can see in the resulting diff.
