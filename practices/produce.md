## Rule
**Produce is step 5 of the five-stage ladder ([promote](promote.md)): a
Promote from staging into main.** `main` is **production** -- what everyone
gets. It runs Promote with the step named:

    python3 tools/precedent_branches.py --promote --to main --work BRANCH

([tools/precedent_branches.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/precedent_branches.py)), with the full local check plus the
GitHub test, and nothing moves unless they pass. A Produce is the named
go-ahead that merging into `main` needs.

**Read it strictly.** "Produce", "production" and "make live" all occur in
ordinary sentences, and this is the step that changes what everyone gets.
It fires only when the message is plainly asking for this step; where the
reading is a genuine judgment call, say it out loud and confirm before
anything moves.

**If Claude Code's own safety check refuses it anyway, stop.** Say in one
line that Claude Code's auto mode stopped the move, not this repository's
rules, and ask for it again in words that name the move ("Produce: staging
into main"). Never route around the check; the durable fix is the person's
([gotcha](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/gotchas/gotcha-2026-09-30-auto-mode-refuses-a-bare-promote-into-main-as-a-production.md)).

## Why
The last step needs a word that is a verb like the others and has the "go
live" feel without "launch", which is common in tech and usually means
something much bigger. A theater production fits the ladder's metaphor.

## Story
Named 2026-09-28. The first word was "Picked up", which is ordinary coding
talk ("CI picked up the change"); "Production" followed, and became the
verb "Produce" so every stage reads as something to do.

## Install
Nothing new: the promotion tool and its checks are
[promote](promote.md)'s.
