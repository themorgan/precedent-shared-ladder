## Rule
When the message you are answering says **"Push directly"** -- case-insensitive,
anywhere in the message, as its own line, a whole sentence, or a clause
inside a longer one, naming a branch or not -- treat it as
[go-update](go-update.md)'s own direct-instruction override, said in a few
words: **sync your local branch, commit the pending work, and push straight
to the target branch, right now, no pull request** -- whatever `Go
update`'s push-by-default/high-risk classification would otherwise call for
on this change.

**The phrase names its own target when the message says so.** "Push
directly to main", "push directly to staging" -- whatever
follows "to" is the branch to push to, full stop, whatever branch a
session might otherwise have guessed.

**Said bare, with no branch named, the target defaults to the primary
branch the work is already headed toward** -- the branch this session's
own work has actually been developed and committed against, never a
repository's configured default branch chosen just because it is
configured that way. Under the branch tiers that is where this person's
Booked (`Go update`) lands, which `python3 tools/precedent_branches.py --landing`
names -- `pre-staging` for a person whose `landing_branch` says so (the
tiered route is opt-in since 2026-09-26); for everyone else, where the repository declares a branch -- `base_branch` in its
`precedent.json`, or a rule of its own -- the declaration decides it
([primary-branch](primary-branch.md)); absent one, it is whichever branch
the change in front of you is already on.

**This is not a new kind of permission.** Booked's Rule already lets a
direct, specific instruction about one change override its own
classification, high-risk included. `Push directly` is that instruction,
standing and reusable, so it does not need to be re-argued in a full
sentence every time it is meant.

**It authorizes this one change, not a standing exemption.** Said about a
different piece of work later, it authorizes that push, to whatever branch
that invocation names or defaults to; it does not turn off the high-risk
classification generally, and Booked still asks the question on the
next change that does not carry this phrase.

Same verification as [go-update](go-update.md): the light check still runs
before the commit and the push check still runs before the push, at the
tier the target branch gets -- basic for pre-staging, full for staging and
main -- so this phrase skips the PR wrapper and the classification, never
the checks. **And
the same landing**: the target is that branch on `origin`, confirmed by a
fetch before the reply reports it
([verify-postcondition](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/verify-postcondition.md)), never a commit left in
the local clone.

**Say the target branch before pushing, every time** -- same reason
[go-update](go-update.md) gives: the failure this catches is silent, not
loud, and looks identical to a correct push until somebody goes looking.
Say it whether the phrase named the branch or left it to the default --
naming it out loud in the reply is what makes the default checkable, not
just correct.

**A step you cannot perform hands off; it does not come back as a
question** -- run [prompt-please](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/prompt-please.md) on the spot, same as
[go-update](go-update.md).

**A person whose `identity.json` sets `promote_only: true` cannot be pushed
to `staging` or `main` this way**: the push gate refuses it. For that
person, "push directly to main" lands on their landing branch and a
Promote moves it up; say so in the reply's first line
([current-rule-governs](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/current-rule-governs.md)) rather than letting the
gate refuse the push.

## Why
Booked's Rule already allows overriding its own high-risk/default
classification with a direct, specific instruction -- but writing that
instruction out in full, "skip the PR even though this touches a
governance practice," costs a sentence every time it is meant. `Push
directly` names the override once, so saying it costs two words, the same
saving Booked (`Go update`, `Approved`) already makes for the base case.

**Naming the branch inline, and defaulting the rest, closes the gap the
original two words left.** A bare "push directly" said nothing about
where, so the phrase that was supposed to save a sentence still cost one
in practice -- confirming a target that was usually never in doubt.
Letting the phrase carry its target when it matters ("to main" versus "to
precedent-beta-v01" are genuinely different instructions) and inherit it
from the work otherwise keeps the phrase to a handful of words in the
case that is actually routine: the target was the branch already being
worked on all along.

## Story
**Retired 2026-09-30.** Morgan: *"push directly we no longer need with our 1-5 steps system but it should be part of the description in the vocab list for booked since that's what it does."* Booked's default is already a direct push, so the phrase added nothing; its description now says so.

Coined 2026-09-20, Morgan, in the same conversation that retired `Go
merge` as a trigger of [go-update](go-update.md). He asked what plain-English
developers say for landing a small change live without a merge, was told
the general answer ("push directly," as opposed to opening a PR and
merging), and once he understood the real cost tradeoff go-update's
push-by-default/high-risk split had just been built around, asked for two
things in the same breath: fold `Go merge` entirely into `Go update`, and
give him a plain, separate phrase for "skip the judgment, just push it"
that he would actually remember to say, rather than "I will forget that
phrase." He used it to authorize landing this file and `Go merge`'s
retirement together -- its first invocation, on a change
[go-update](go-update.md)'s own Rule would otherwise classify as high-risk,
since it edits a governance practice directly.

**Amended the same day.** Reading the freshly-coined phrase back, Morgan
asked for it to say its target the way a person actually would --
"push directly to `[main]`", with `[main]` standing for whichever branch
is really the primary one in play, not the literal word `main` -- and for
a bare "Push directly" with nothing named after it to default to that same
primary branch rather than leave a session to guess or stop and ask. He
invoked the amended phrase, in the same message that asked for the
amendment, to authorize landing the amendment itself: "Push directly to
precedent-beta-v01" -- naming this repo's actual routine branch, not
`main`, exactly the distinction [merge-target-is-beta-branch](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/local/practices/merge-target-is-beta-branch.md)
exists to keep a session from blurring.

## Install
Nothing mechanical checks that the phrase was honoured, same reason
[go-update](go-update.md) gives: this governs how a chat message is read, not
a property of the diff. What is checkable downstream is what
[go-update](go-update.md)'s own Install section names: the push lands on the
branch named in the reply, with no open pull request wrapping it.
