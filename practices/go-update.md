## Rule
**"Booked" is this step's name. "Go update", "Approved", "Book", "Book it",
"Shared Save" and "Promote 3" all mean the same thing**: land the work on
the landing branch -- pre-staging, the shared save, for anyone who uses the
three tiers. Say "Booked" when talking about the step; "Go update" is its
older name and keeps working. This file is stage 3,
**Booked**, of the five-stage ladder ([promote](promote.md), and
[spec/FIVE_STAGES_AND_OUR_LANGUAGE_PLAN.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/spec/FIVE_STAGES_AND_OUR_LANGUAGE_PLAN.md)):
the step that moves a session's work off its feature branch to somewhere it
won't be lost. When it is asked for by a stage word, it is read back as a
stage first (*"Now Promote 3: Booked, the Shared Save -- moving
`<date>-<slug>-<id>` into pre-staging (BestPractice)"*). For anyone
not using the ladder, Booked (`Go update`) behaves exactly as below, word for word.
Read any of these words for what the message means in the conversation it
arrives in, not as a string to match: "book it if there's anything to
book; if not, promote", said after a day of landing and promoting, asks
for exactly this, and a word missing from the vocabulary is a reason to
read the recent plans and the thread, not to call it unknown.

If the message you are answering tells you to `Go update` --
case-insensitive, **anywhere in the message**, as its own line, as a whole
sentence, or as a clause inside a longer one -- treat it as authorization,
right there, to: **sync your local branch with origin, say out loud which
branch you are merging into, commit the pending work, push the branch, open
a pull request (or confirm one is already open), and merge it** -- using the
repo's usual conventions, without asking again first.

**The phrase is not scoped to the git sequence itself — it authorizes doing
whatever finishing the thing in front of it actually requires.** Where
landing the change really is sync/commit/push/PR/merge, do exactly that.
Where the request needs something else, do that instead of forcing the git
sequence onto work it doesn't fit. And where it turns out nothing needs
doing at all — the change already exists, or the request has no repository
action to take — **say so plainly instead of manufacturing a commit or a
merge just to satisfy the phrase.** The authorization is for finishing the
work, not for performing the ritual regardless of whether the work calls
for it.

**The default is to act on it.** Nothing about the phrase's position, the
punctuation around it, or what was said before it changes the answer, and
you do not have to have announced that you are ready to commit first. Said
before you have mentioned committing at all, it means get ready and go.

**It means what this file says today.** An older copy of this rule in
someone's own set, an installed instructions file, a sync note that
declined it, or this file's own history narrows nothing. Those are records
of earlier decisions, read only to investigate or to propose reconsidering
the rule, and never while deciding whether to run it
([current-rule-governs](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/current-rule-governs.md)).

**Classify the pending change before running that chain — and the default
has flipped.** Until 2026-09-20 the default was the full chain, with a
narrow trivial carve-out for a direct push. That carve-out was too narrow:
a dependent repo's own GitHub Actions history, read directly rather than
assumed, showed a routine pull request billing a Light check plus a full,
un-debounced documentation check that a direct push to the same branch
skips outright — cost paid for edits that carried none of the risk a PR
exists to catch. **The default is now a direct push, straight to the
branch, no PR — for everything except a narrow, strict set of high-risk
changes:**

- **High-risk** — the change does at least one of these:
  - **Touches enforcement or gating code** — a check other work is judged
    against
    ([tools/precedent_check.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/precedent_check.py),
    [tools/leak_gate.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/leak_gate.py),
    [tools/verify_harness.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/verify_harness.py),
    a CI workflow file, a repo's own branch-restriction rule). A bad direct
    push here does not just break one thing — it silently stops catching
    the next hundred.
  - **Changes a governance or authorization practice** — one whose job is
    to grant, gate, or record an approval (this file,
    [weak-yes.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/weak-yes.md), [decision-strength.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/decision-strength.md),
    [open-item-disposition.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/open-item-disposition.md), a repo's own
    merge-target rule). Loosening the rules that govern changes is a
    different order of risk than loosening anything else.
  - **Is hard to reverse once live** — a force-push, a delete or overwrite
    with no straightforward undo, anything touching credentials, billing,
    or access, or a change to something an outside party already depends
    on (a link already sent to people, an install script another repo
    runs unattended).
  - **You are not confident it falls outside the first three.** Default UP
    to high-risk, never down — the cost of one unneeded PR is a few CI
    minutes; the cost of a bad direct push is whatever it broke, found
    later, by someone else.
- **Everything else pushes straight to the branch, no PR.** A new
  practice, a rule's meaning changing in ordinary content, real logic in
  ordinary code, a change spanning several files or systems — none of
  that alone makes a change high-risk. **Size and reach are not the test; only
  the four bullets above are.** The light check still runs before the
  commit and the push check still runs before the push either way, at the
  tier the target branch gets -- basic for pre-staging, full for staging
  and main ([spec/BRANCH_TIERS_PLAN.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/spec/BRANCH_TIERS_PLAN.md)) --
  so verification never gets skipped, only the PR wrapper does.

**Either path ends on the shared branch, never in the local clone.**
`Go update` means make the change live: the direct push lands on the branch
the repository's own rules say routine work lands on, and the full chain
merges into that same branch -- in both cases a real branch on `origin`,
and never a repository's *configured default* branch picked just because
it is configured that way. **When that branch is pre-staging and the change was high-risk, the reply
says so in one plain line, in The Boildown** -- not bolded, not urgent,
for example *"Pre-staging is 2 commits ahead of staging; it can be
promoted whenever it suits."* It is information, not a call to act now, and never a reason to keep the
session open: the archive line ignores it
([the-boildown-on-the-ladder](the-boildown-on-the-ladder.md)).
A high-risk change lands on pre-staging like any other rather than jumping
the queue, so the two branches do not drift apart, and gets its full check
at the next Promote, whenever that comes. Morgan, 2026-09-25, reversing the
bolded "Please move this to staging soon" call to action set earlier that
day: the bold, urgent wording pressed him to promote very often, and with
several windows open that had two sessions promoting at once and racing
(*"change that wording so it is NOT bolded and worded very gently, without
urgency"*, strength: decided). That branch is the
person's primary branch
([primary-branch](primary-branch.md)), and
`python3 tools/precedent_branches.py --landing` names it: the branch the
repository declares, `base_branch` in its `precedent.json`, which in most
repositories is `main` -- unless the person's `landing_branch` says
`pre-staging`, the tiered route, opt-in per person since 2026-09-26 (Morgan:
*"This forced pre-staging -> staging -> main should be mandatory for me, but
not necessarily anyone else"*, strength: decided), or `main` itself, which skips staging but never
the checks, and still answers to the repository's own rule about main. **A person's own
`landing_branch` always wins; a repository's, in its `precedent.json`, is its default
for anyone who names none**, and a new install or an Update Vendors writes it as
`pre-staging` where it is missing (Morgan, 2026-09-27, strength: decided: *"have the
individual repo take precedence over the others (if it set, use that)"*). **Landing on pre-staging,
bring it in first**: `python3 tools/precedent_branches.py
--sync-pre-staging` creates it from staging when origin has none, and
copies into it what reached staging or main by another route once that
has had its tier's checks -- it only looks here, since a GitHub test can
take many minutes, and names `--check` for anything still unchecked, which
[promote](promote.md) runs -- then merge `origin/pre-staging` into the work
before pushing, so every window lands on top of the others. Getting it onto staging is a separate step,
[promote](promote.md).
**A commit sitting in the working copy has not satisfied the phrase, and
neither has a push you only know succeeded because the command said so:**
name the postcondition and test it
([verify-postcondition](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/verify-postcondition.md)) -- fetch, and confirm
`origin/<branch>` actually carries the commit -- before reporting where the
work went. Where the push cannot run from this session at all, that is the
blocked-step handoff below, said plainly; it is never a local commit
reported as done.

**This is the standing default for how `Go update` (and its synonyms) are
read when nothing else qualifies them — it does not override a direct,
specific instruction about this one change.** Told to skip the PR on
something that would otherwise count as high-risk, or to open one for something
that would otherwise push straight through, that instruction governs; the
classification above is only what runs in its absence.

**Say which path you took and why, in one clause, in the reply.** Not
"pushed the fix" — *"pushed directly (content change, not gating code)"*
or *"opened a PR (touches
[tools/precedent_check.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/precedent_check.py),
a gating check)"*. A
path taken without its reason is exactly as unreviewable as no reason at
all.

**`Approved` means the same thing.** Said of the work in front of you --
as its own line, as a whole sentence, or as a clause accepting what you just
proposed or showed -- it carries the identical authorization, the identical
chain, and the identical branch-naming step. There is no weaker reading of
it: it is not "noted", it is not "go ahead and I will merge it later", and it
does not become a question about whether he meant the command.

**`Go merge` is retired as a trigger.** Say `Go update` (or `Approved`)
instead -- both carry the identical authorization, the identical chain,
and the identical branch-naming step this file has always described. A
message that still says "go merge" in plain English is read the way any
intent is: if it plainly asks for this authorization, treat it as one, per
the no-phrase-required paragraph below -- it is simply no longer one of the
phrases guaranteed to be recognized on its own. For the case where the size
call is already made and the PR should be skipped outright, the person says
so ("push it directly"), and the push goes straight to the branch; the
phrase that used to carry this, push-directly, was retired on 2026-09-30,
since a direct push is already this step's default.

**Neither of the two phrases is required for the authorization to exist —
they are the unambiguous case, not the only case.** A message can plainly
authorize a merge without any of them in it: "sold, ship it", "yes, let's
do this", "that's exactly what I wanted, put it up" all read as this
command to a reasonable person, and treating them as anything less is
answering a clear yes with a question. **The phrases stay valuable because
they remove the one thing intent-reading cannot: doubt.** Say one of them
and the chain runs, full stop, no matter how the sentence around it reads.

**Where the phrase is absent and the sentence leaves genuine doubt, say
your reading out loud and get it confirmed before running the push, the
pull request, or the merge — never guess silently in either direction.**
"I'm reading that as authorization to go merge this — say so if that's not
what you meant" costs one line and is cheap; a merge nobody actually asked
for, or work left sitting because a real go-ahead was read as small talk,
both cost more than that line. This is *not* license to ask about
phrasing that already reads as a clear yes — asking there is the exact
interruption this practice exists to remove — it is for the sentence that
could honestly go either way. Committing locally is never blocked on
this: do that regardless, and hold only the steps that touch the shared
branch until the reading is confirmed.

**Say the target branch before pushing or merging, every time --
including on the direct-push default, which is now the common path.** It is
spelled out here rather than left inside "usual conventions" because that is
the step whose silent failure is expensive: a push or a merge onto the wrong
branch, or a commit that never left the clone, looks identical to a correct
one in the reply until somebody goes looking.

**A step you cannot perform hands off; it does not come back as a
question.** If the push, the pull request or the merge is refused because
this session cannot reach the repository -- a cross-owner `add_repo`
refusal, no push access, a repository nobody attached -- **the
authorization is still good and it travels with the work.** Run
[prompt-please](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/prompt-please.md) on the spot: write up the residue as one
paste-ready prompt naming which repository to root a new session in, carry
the authorization with it per that practice's own bounds, and put the
prompt in the reply. **Finish everything this session can do first** --
sync, commit, push where the push works -- so only the residue moves.
Reporting the refusal and stopping there is the one wrong answer.

**A refusal by Claude Code's auto mode is not that.** Its safety check
can refuse a push or a merge this repository's rules allow ("Merge
Without Review", 2026-10-01). Handing that to another session would be
routing around it. Say in one line that auto mode stopped it, not this
repository's rules, and ask for it again in words that name it: "Merge
PR #N into pre-staging".

**What the receiving session may then DO with the relayed phrase is
[relayed-authorization](relayed-authorization.md)'s**: it merges only where
the person's own `identity.json` says they accept relays, and otherwise stops
at the pull request. So a handoff can end with the work finished and the
merge still waiting on one word said in the other window -- that is the
declaration's absence, not a failed relay, and the reply says which word and
where.

**A branch another session made is merged only once that session, or the
person, has said it is finished.** Its existence on the remote is not that.
On 2026-09-29 a session merged `claude/derived-session-ceiling-7qk2` into
precedent-individual's pre-staging, and a Promote carried it to main: a
ceiling raise its own session had held back because Morgan had rejected it.
When the branch's status cannot be settled from its session or its pull
request, ask before merging it.

**In a repository that vendors Precedent, the landing takes the vendor
update with it.** After syncing with origin and committing, and before the
push, run `python3 tools/precedent_merge_vendors.py`. Nothing behind, it says
`VENDORS: current` in about the time a fetch takes. Behind, it runs Update
Vendors from the BestPractice clone and either commits the result as a commit
of its own, which lands with the work, or takes everything it wrote back and
says why (`VENDORS: NOT TAKEN`). It never blocks the landing. Its `VENDORS:`
line goes in the reply, and a NOT TAKEN reason is a question for the person,
asked there (Alex, 2026-10-02: "Can we set up a system so merge also does
vendor updates?").

## Detail
"That was perfect. Go update", "Go update.", a lone line reading
`GO UPDATE`, "go update it and tell me what broke", and "when the check
passes, go update" all count. What does not is the word being used about
something else -- "go update the branch, then look at the diff", "can you
update TODO.md first", "go update your local clone before you start" --
where `update` has its own object and is plainly not an instruction about
the work in front of you.

**`Approved` has the same shape and one more way to be about something
else, because it is an ordinary adjective as well as a verb.** "Approved.",
"Approved -- ship it", "that's approved, go" all count. What does not is the
word modifying a noun that is not the work in front of you -- "the approved
plan of record", "Alex has not approved that yet", "an approved practice
source" -- or a question about approval rather than a grant of it, "has this
been approved?". **The test is the same one the rest of this file uses: if
you can tell what would be merged and the word is being said about it,
merge it.** A message that says `approved` about work you have not yet shown
him, where nothing is pending, is the one case worth a question -- and the
question is *which* work, never whether the word meant what it said.

**"Blocked" means a call came back refused, not that you expect one to.**
`Go update` is not an invitation to go looking for reasons the merge might
not be allowed; try the step, and hand off on what the tool actually said,
quoting it. A restriction the repository itself declares on a branch is a
different thing and is handed off nowhere -- the phrase authorizes a merge,
it does not lift a branch rule, so a merge that waits for review goes on
waiting for review.

**High-risk reads narrowly, not generously — the opposite bias from the old
trivial test.** "Fixed a bug in
[tools/precedent_check.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/precedent_check.py)",
"changed what
[tools/leak_gate.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/leak_gate.py)
enforces", "edited `go-update.md` itself" are high-risk, even at one line, even
when the fix is obviously correct — because what they touch is the
machinery that catches mistakes, or the rule that governs how changes
land. "Fixed a typo in
[README.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/README.md)",
"reworded a confusing sentence", "added a new practice about doc-link
formatting", "rewrote a function's internals without touching what calls
it or what it's checked against" are not high-risk, however large the diff,
because none of them touches enforcement, governance, or anything hard to
reverse. **The test is never the size of the diff, and it is no longer
"did the meaning change" — it is whether the change hits one of the four
high-risk criteria in the Rule above.**

**Once one of the two phrases is there, ask about the object, never about
the phrasing.** The one question worth stopping for is *which* pending work
is meant, and only when several unrelated branches are genuinely in play.
Asking whether the words were meant as the command produces exactly the
interruption the command exists to remove: if you can tell what would be
merged, merge it. This is a different case from the phrase being absent
altogether — there, the confirmation above is about whether the message
authorizes anything at all, not about which branch it means.

**This is shorthand for an authorization, never a new kind of permission.**
It says the person has approved *this* merge; it does not widen what may be
merged, and it does not survive into the next one. Where a repository
restricts a particular branch -- a release branch, a pinned integration
branch, a `main` behind review -- that restriction still holds, and
`Go update` with no branch named means the branch the repository's own rules
say routine work lands on.

## Why
A standing phrase costs the person two words instead of a re-explanation in
every session, and it survives the session that heard it. The alternative is
being asked the same question across sessions forever, which is the exact
annoyance it exists to remove.

**A trigger that has to be recognized cannot be fussy about how it is
typed.** Every condition attached to the phrase -- a required position in
the message, a preceding statement of readiness, a standing invitation to
ask when it reads ambiguously -- is one more way for a session to answer an
authorization with a question, which is the one failure this practice
exists to prevent. The strictness buys nothing back: the expensive mistake
is merging into the wrong branch, and the spoken-branch step in the Rule is
what guards that, not the shape of the trigger.

**Universal rather than per-person, and that reverses a 2026-09-07
decision.** The rule this supersedes told every adopting repository to go
adopt a merge keyword of its own, which is a preference dressed as a
practice, and it was retired for that. Naming ONE phrase and shipping it
with the engine is a different thing: Morgan, 2026-09-08 -- *"we should have
our own commands we use for people who live in our universe."* An adopter
gets a working vocabulary out of the box instead of a homework assignment,
and a session moving between repositories reads the same word everywhere.

**A refusal that ends the turn spends the authorization and delivers
nothing.** The person said two words to avoid being asked a question, and
"I could not, permissions" hands them back the whole job plus a new one:
working out which session could have done it. The session that hit the wall
is holding the branch, the diff and the reason it stopped -- it is better
placed than anyone to write that handoff, and writing it costs one call.

## Story
It began as one person's shorthand, from typing `go` / `merge` /
`PR & merge` session after session. Revised 2026-09-04 after two confusions
surfaced in one conversation: a session's local branch was badly stale
against origin, and -- separately, already on record -- a pull request had
once merged silently into the wrong branch. Neither was caused by the
keyword, and both came down to the same gap: a Rule that says "using the
repo's usual conventions" trusts the sync-and-correct-branch check
invisibly. The three triggers collapsed into one phrase (`go` and `merge`
are too common as ordinary words to trust alone), and the sync/branch
confirmation became an explicit, spoken step.

Revised again 2026-09-05 to spell out push and pull request as their own
steps rather than leaving them inside "usual conventions" -- so the full
chain is visible, not just its two ends.

**Loosened 2026-09-12, on Morgan's decision**, after a run of sessions
began treating the phrase as something to qualify for rather than something
to act on: *"In the last hour, you have become much much stricter in
accepting a go merge. I don't like that."* Nothing in the wording had
changed. The file had sat untouched since the 2026-09-08 move, no source
carried an edit near it, and the whole repository's last commit before the
complaint was about an unrelated practice -- so the strictness was not new
text but the conditions the text had always carried, read tightly. Three
came out: the message-final position, the requirement that the session have
already said it was ready to commit, and the invitation to ask when the
phrasing read ambiguously. The branch-naming step, which is the part
actually protecting anything, was left exactly as it was.

**A second phrase, `Approved`, added 2026-09-13 on Morgan's instruction:**
*"To the 'go merge' command, also add: if I say 'approved', that also means
the same as gold merge."* It is one command with two triggers rather than two
practices, because everything after the trigger -- the chain, the spoken
branch, the blocked-step handoff, the fact that it authorizes this merge and
not the next one -- is identical, and a second file would be the same rule
maintained twice. The word is riskier than `Go merge` in exactly one way:
`merge` needs an object to be about something else, where `approved` is
already an adjective this repository uses about plans and sources in ordinary
prose, so the Detail above names that case explicitly.

**Extended 2026-09-13, on Morgan raising it**, out of a `Go merge` he had
just run that came back as a repository-permissions problem: *"if you don't
have permission to do the go merge (or a part of it) because of cross repo
issues, then you can spawn a new session to do so."* The chain in the Rule
had always assumed every step of it was reachable from wherever the phrase
was read, and `session-text` -- written about work that
has not started yet -- did not obviously govern a chain that stopped
halfway. So the session that hit it reported the refusal and stopped, which
is what he was looking at when he asked.

**Moved to universal 2026-09-08, on Morgan's decision**, from his private
individual set. The move is also what makes the phrase readable at all by a
session that has not attached a private source -- which had already happened
once: a session followed an instruction to go ask what "Go merge" meant,
generating the precise interruption the phrase exists to prevent, while the
definition sat in a repository nobody had fetched.

**The trivial/substantial split added 2026-09-15, on Morgan's decision**,
raised after he noticed two things sitting side by side. A session had
pushed two engine bug fixes straight to `precedent-beta-v01` with no pull
request -- real, verified fixes, landed on nothing but the same session's
own report that its deep check passed. Separately, he had been typing
`Go merge` for one-line typo fixes and paying the full PR round-trip every
time, for work that carried none of the first case's risk. Two shapes were
proposed and discussed in the open before either was written: banning
direct edits outright, and renaming the command itself (to `Go update`) so
a new phrase would front-load the judgment call. Both were set aside --
a ban would have made every typo fix cost a PR again, and a rename breaks a
phrase already propagated to every source that vendors this file, for a
problem that was never about the name. What was missing was the
classification step itself, so it went into the existing chain rather than
a new one. *"Sold. Let's do it. Go merge."*

**A third phrase, `Go update`, added later the same day, on Morgan's
decision, after he reconsidered the rename he had just set aside.** He came
back to it directly: *"I thought about it, and I'd like to do it anyway
despite your reasoning... I think the solution is to allow BOTH words to be
used! If we treat Go Merge and Go Update as the same, then it's easier to
justify to people like Alex... it's a secondary synonym in case people say
the wrong thing, but it really is a 'go update it', not necessarily
merge."* This is not the rename that was set aside hours earlier -- that
would have broken a phrase already propagated to every source vendoring
this file, for a problem that was never about the name. A synonym breaks
nothing: `Go merge` keeps meaning exactly what it always meant, and `Go
update` now means the same thing beside it. Same shape as `Approved`'s
addition two days earlier -- one command, now three triggers, maintained
once.

**Revised 2026-09-15, on Morgan's decision, to state the scope explicitly
rather than leave it implied by the worked examples.** He put it this way:
*"'Go merge' doesn't mean just merge but 'Do what you need to, to make it
happen -- and if there is nothing to do, then just TELL ME!'"* The git
sequence was always the common case, not the definition; this makes that
explicit before a session reads the Rule too literally and either forces a
merge onto a task that doesn't need one, or stays silent when the honest
answer is that nothing was left to do.

**Revised 2026-09-16, on Alex's design point and Morgan's decision, to
recognize the intent rather than only the three phrases.** Alex's framing,
relayed by Morgan: a session should ask itself whether a message reads as
this authorization, not scan it for the trigger words. Morgan agreed and
set the boundary for how far that goes on an action this size: *"apply the
same to the ones that are a serious decision such as Go Merge, Weak Yes,
etc -- and just note that (if the exact phrase isn't used), then use your
judgment and ASK the person if you have doubt."* This is why the confirm
step above holds only the shared-branch steps, and only when the reading is
genuinely in doubt -- not a general license to question a clear yes, which
is the interruption this practice has always existed to remove.

**Reversed 2026-09-18, on Morgan's decision, to make `Go update` the
phrase the assistant leads with, recommends, and reaches for first --
`Go merge` stays exactly as valid, just second.** He named the seam his
own 2026-09-15 words had already found: *"it's not about the merge because
many times it's not a merge but a direct edit."* Asked directly for the
ordering to flip, not for a rename -- a rename was declined again, for the
same reason it was declined on 2026-09-15, propagation to every source
that vendors this file for a problem that was never about the name. Both
phrases keep meaning exactly the same thing, with the identical
authorization and the identical chain; only which one comes first, in the
frontmatter and in the assistant's own mouth, changed.

**The push-by-default/high-risk split replaced trivial/substantial 2026-09-20,
on Morgan's decision, after a session reviewing CI cost in a dependent
repo found two of four recent pull requests
paying for a Light check and a full documentation-check run that a direct
push to the same branch would have skipped — for changes the trivial
carve-out should have caught but an earlier session had classified as
substantial instead.** Told the fix would cut that class of CI spend by
roughly two-thirds, Morgan corrected the scope twice before deciding.
**First**, that "pushed straight to the branch" means the repo's own
routine branch (`precedent-beta-v01` here, not `main`), not a name to
hardcode. **Second**, that the carve-out was never about wording alone:
*"it is not just SINGLE WORDING changes; it should be for all NON-HUGE
changes... have VERY STRICT CRITERIA for being a huge change."* Asked
whether this was his own working habit or a change to the shared rule, he
was explicit: *"Make this a universal rule 100%. This should be changed
universally"* — while noting that a direct, specific instruction about one
change always overrides the default, which is what the Rule's closing
paragraph on this now says. The four high-risk criteria (gating code,
governance practices, hard-to-reverse actions, and doubt itself) are this
session's own draft against his instruction to make them strict, not
dictated by him line for line — he set the shape and the bar, not the
wording.

**`Go merge` retired as a separate trigger, later the same day, on
Morgan's decision.** Once `Go update` always decided push-vs-high-risk and
always announced which path it took, keeping a second, permanently-equal
phrase stopped earning its keep in his own words: *"I think we changed
'go update' and are no longer using 'go merge'; 'go update' should now:
decide if this is big or small, and if it's small, push directly, and if
it's big, merge it,"* and *"let's remove entirely the 'go merge' phrase/
trigger, and only 'go update' for that."* Both behaviors were already true
of the Rule above -- what changed is that `Go merge` no longer stands
beside `Go update` as a second, guaranteed-recognized trigger. This is not
the rename declined on 2026-09-15 and 2026-09-18: the slug and file stay
`go-update`, so nothing that cites [go-update](go-update.md) breaks; only the
set of phrases a session is guaranteed to recognize shrank by one. A
separate, narrower phrase, push-directly (retired 2026-09-30), was coined
the same conversation for skipping the high-risk/default judgment call
itself, which `Go update` still always makes.

**Renamed `huge` to `high-risk` 2026-09-21, on Morgan's decision, for
formality — no change to the four criteria themselves.** Asked to
recommend a less informal replacement, the session proposed `high-risk`
over `major` specifically because [merge-target-is-beta-branch](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/local/practices/merge-target-is-beta-branch.md)
already uses "major changes" for a different gate (Alex's sign-off on a
`main` merge) — reusing it here would have made two distinct gates read
as one. Morgan confirmed and asked for the rename to reach every mention.
The two direct quotes from the 2026-09-20 decision above, which used
`huge`/`NON-HUGE` in Morgan's own words, are left as said rather than
edited to match; only this file's own vocabulary — the Rule, the Detail,
and the surrounding narration in this Story — changed.

**The landing target made explicit 2026-09-22, on Morgan's decision**, after
he asked whether the command actually said where an update lands -- and named
the failure it lets through: *"This helps avoid the problem of, I tell it to
update, and it does so but only the local clone only."* Read back, the file
said it twice for the full chain (sync with origin, push, pull request,
merge) and never once for the direct push that the 2026-09-20 split had just
made the **default** path: "pushes straight to the branch, no PR" named no
branch and no remote, and the spoken-branch step said *before merging*, so on
the common path it read as not applying at all. Nothing here changed what
`Go update` authorizes -- a push to the shared branch was always what it
meant. What changed is that the direct-push path now says so in the same
words the merge path always did, and the postcondition
([verify-postcondition](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/verify-postcondition.md)) is named where a session
will hit it: `origin/<branch>` carries the commit, confirmed by a fetch, not
by what `git push` printed.

**2026-09-26: the slug follows the phrase.** `Go merge` stopped being a
trigger on 2026-09-20, but the file stayed `go-merge.md` and the slug
`go-merge`, so every index line, link and gate list kept printing the
retired word. A session then wrote "your `go-merge` rule" to Morgan while
applying `Go update`, and he asked whether the rename had not already
happened. It had, for the phrase only. Renamed the same day on his `Go
update`. `practices/go-merge.md` stays behind as `status: deduplicated`,
`in_force_at: go-update` -- the same shape `merge-authorization-keyword`
was left in when this practice replaced it -- so links in the practice sets
and in already-vendored copies keep resolving.

**2026-09-29: Booked leads.** Morgan asked for "Booked" to be the name
listed first, with "Go update" as its synonym -- "and not just in the vocab,
but that's how you should talk about it." The `command:` object now opens
with Booked, so Vocabulary prints Booked with "Go update" trailing as a
synonym, and a session names the step Booked. The slug stays `go-update`:
renaming it would break links in every consuming repo for a name no reader
sees.

## Install
No mechanical check, and not for lack of trying: this governs how a chat
message is *read*, not any property of a diff, a commit, or the tree.
Nothing left behind afterwards distinguishes "recognized the authorization
and merged" from "merged on its own initiative while those words happened to
appear somewhere in the message" -- both leave the identical commit and
merge. The
only place the distinction exists is the conversation, which no repo-scoped
script can see, and even there it is a judgment call about intent rather
than a signature to pattern-match.

What IS checkable is downstream and already covered: the merge target
(wherever a repository declares one) and the closing link to the merged pull
request's page, where the one-click delete-branch button lives.

**The push-by-default/high-risk split is partly checkable, which the
trivial/substantial split it replaced never was.** Two of the four high-risk
criteria are still a judgment call no diff can settle alone — "hard to
reverse" and "not confident" both require reading what changed, not just
where. But **"touches enforcement or gating code" and "changes a
governance practice" are close to mechanical**: a fixed list of paths
([tools/precedent_check.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/precedent_check.py),
[tools/leak_gate.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/leak_gate.py),
[tools/verify_harness.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/verify_harness.py),
`.github/workflows/*`, the governance practices named in the Rule above)
and a check could flag a direct push landing on one of them with no open
pull request. Recorded rather than left silent; not built here.
