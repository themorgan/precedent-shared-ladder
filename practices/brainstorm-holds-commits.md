## Rule
When a conversation is a **Brainstorm** -- the person says the word, or the
thread is plainly exploratory ("I'm wondering", "what are my options", "do
you have ideas") -- **hold the edit, not just the commit: write nothing to
the repository until they authorize the work.** Research, argue the case,
propose the design; do not create, edit, commit, push, open a pull request
or merge. Answering a question inside it is not authorization, and neither
is enthusiasm for the idea. **When in doubt, it is a brainstorm.**

## Detail
**What holding the edit means, and what ends a brainstorm** -- moved out of
the Rule on 2026-09-21 (see `## Story`), unchanged:

A session that writes files and then asks whether to commit has already made
the decision, because a working tree it left dirty is one a Stop hook or a
later turn will push to finish. Say what you would write and where; wait to
be told. A brainstorm ends only when the person authorizes the work --
Booked (`Go update`), "do it", "write it up", or anything else unambiguous.

**The cost of getting it wrong is asymmetric and not close**, which is why
the Rule's default is what it is: holding costs one question at the end of a
reply, and guessing wrong puts commits in someone's history that they did
not want, on a branch they now have to read before they can trust it.

**A directive inside an exploratory thread is still a directive.** "Make
this a practice" is an instruction to build, even if the three messages
before it were speculation. What the state changes is the default, not the
person's ability to ask for something.

**This does not reach the person's own house-keeping.** A brainstorm still
ends its turn honestly: if a repository's tooling has already left the tree
dirty, say so plainly rather than committing to tidy it away.

**It narrows `small-calls`, and that is the whole reason this is written
down.** Where a source in force says to default to continuing rather than
asking -- to make the call and note it, reserving the interruption for
decisions that are costly to undo -- a brainstorm is the standing exception.
Capturing an open item is exactly the shape that rule calls small: cheap,
reversible, keeps the work moving. It is also, in an exploratory thread, the
thing not to do. The two rules have different slugs, so no precedence
mechanism decides between them and nothing reports a conflict -- which is
why the brainstorm state has to be named here, in the rule that knows about
it, rather than left for a session to arbitrate mid-thread.

## Why
**Thinking happens privately with the assistant; the results get shared.**
That is what the repository is for, and it is the whole argument: a
repository holds conclusions, and thinking out loud is not a conclusion.
Morgan, 2026-09-08, on why this belongs at universal rather than in one
person's own set -- *"we want brainstorming to happen privately thinking
with Claude, and the results shared."* Nobody wants their half-formed
options in the record, and everybody wants what they settled on to be there.

That also settles the edges without further rules. It says why Booked
is the exit -- it is the moment something became a result. It says why
enthusiasm mid-thread is not: agreeing that an idea is interesting is not
concluding anything. And it says why the rule survives a session boundary,
where a preference about interruptions would not: the repository outlives
the conversation, so what lands in it is a different question from what is
convenient to ask right now.

There is a second cost, easy to miss and pointing the same way. Once a
session has written a proposal into the tree, its next reply is arguing for
something it already built, and the person is reviewing a fait accompli
rather than weighing an idea. Holding the edit keeps the conversation about
the idea.

## Story
2026-09-08. A thread that began *"I'm wondering if there's a better way"*
and ran through *"maybe this is a terrible idea. What do you think?"*
produced two commits, both pushed, neither asked for. The work itself was
not wrong -- open items recorded, no deliverable touched -- and that is what
makes the incident worth writing down rather than shrugging at: nothing
failed loudly, and the session's own reasoning at each step was that
capturing an open item is cheap and reversible. It filed each one under
"repo is memory" and pushed. Morgan, the same day: *"Multiple times today
you committed to github on your own without my telling you, and I didn't
want you to."*

The reasoning was not wrong about capture; it was wrong about who decides
when. `repo-is-memory` says a decision must not live only in a thread. It
does not say a session may decide, on the person's behalf, that something
has become a decision.

**Rule compressed 2026-09-21**, in the reduction pass recorded in
[todo-2026-09-21-resident-cap-was-measured-on-the-wrong-shape.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/todo/todo-2026-09-21-resident-cap-was-measured-on-the-wrong-shape.md).
221 tokens -> 117, at that point the largest entry in the resident block.
Nothing was dropped: the dirty-tree reasoning and the list of phrases that
end a brainstorm moved into `## Detail` above, and *"when in doubt, it is a
brainstorm"* moved the other way, up into the Rule, because it is the
operative default rather than a gloss on one. Morgan asked for this pass by
name after taking the three that came before it.

**Tightened 2026-10-01** in the reduction pass Morgan approved that day
("all are great, approved", strength: decided). "It ends only when the
person authorizes the work" folded into the first sentence, which now says
*until they authorize the work*; the Detail keeps the list of what counts.
It stays resident, because its push and merge gates fire too late to hold an
edit.

## Install
**No mechanical check, and the reason is the same one
[go-update](go-update.md) records:**
the trigger lives in the conversation, and nothing left behind afterwards
distinguishes a commit made under authorization from one made on a
session's own initiative. Both leave the identical commit.

**The environment actively pulls the other way, and an adopting repo should
know it.** A `Stop` hook that refuses to end a turn while the working tree
is dirty -- Precedent ships one at
`templates/harness/claude-code/hooks/stop-git-check.sh` and instantiates it
for its own repository -- will block a session that correctly declined
to commit, and the obvious way out of that block is to commit. That is why
this practice holds the *edit* rather than the commit: a brainstorm that
writes nothing never reaches the hook, so the two mechanisms stop fighting.
Do not weaken the Stop hook to make room for this one; it is load-bearing
for the ordinary case, where uncommitted work is work about to be lost.
