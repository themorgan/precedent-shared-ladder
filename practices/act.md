## Rule
**Act is step 2 of the five-stage ladder ([promote](promote.md)): make the
change.** The work lives on this session's own **feature branch** -- the
short-lived branch named like `claude/<date>-<slug>-<id>` -- and is **pushed
there**, so a reclaimed container loses nothing. It is not shared yet:
nothing reaches pre-staging until [Booked](go-update.md).

**The branch is named when Act starts, by
[tools/precedent_branch_name.py](../tools/precedent_branch_name.py), never
by hand**: `git switch -c "$(python3 tools/precedent_branch_name.py <a few
words>)"` gives `claude/2026-10-01-feature-branch-naming-awpkv` -- the day,
what the work is, and the last five characters of the session's ID,
lowercased, so the name leads back to the session. With no session ID, or
the name already on GitHub, the tool puts five random characters there
instead and says so. A branch the harness named when the session opened,
before the task was known (`claude/hopeful-carson-yy42sb`), is left alone:
the session makes its named branch at Act and works there.

**Act comes after [Consider](consider.md)**, even if the plan is one line.
A request to build with no plan yet gets the one-line plan first, in the
same reply.

**A feature branch is easy to forget**, which is why Act never ends a
session on its own. Work that reached Act but not Booked is said plainly
at the end of the reply, with Booked recommended
([the-boildown](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/the-boildown.md)).

## Why
Building straight onto a shared branch skips the checks and the chance to
change course; building only in the container loses the work when the
session ends. The feature branch is the one place that is both private and
safe.

## Story
Named 2026-09-27. Morgan first wrote "local clone" for this stage, then
corrected it: he meant the session's feature branch on GitHub, and Booked
is the step that moves it somewhere it will not be forgotten.

**Branch names**, 2026-10-01. Morgan pointed out that the branches sessions
leave behind are hard to connect to what they did: the harness names a
session's branch when it opens, before anyone knows the task
(`claude/hopeful-carson-yy42sb`), and sessions that made up their own
"random" ending repeated it -- three branches in BestPractice ended in
`-7qk2`. He asked for date, slug and an identifier, then chose the
session ID's ending over random characters ("I love the idea to use the
session ID"), with random characters only where there is no ID or the name
is taken. "Yes, let's do it. Act and Booked" (strength: decided).

## Install
The naming tool ships with the engine ([precedent_branch_name.py](../tools/precedent_branch_name.py) in
[tools/precedent_vendor_engine.py](../tools/precedent_vendor_engine.py)'s
`ENGINE_FILES`); it reads the session ID through
`precedent_detect.this_session_id()` and the date through
`precedent_time`. The reply gate already says when a feature branch holds
work that has not landed.
