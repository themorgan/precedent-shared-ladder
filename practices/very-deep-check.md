## Rule
When a person explicitly asks for a "very deep check", run
[tools/very_deep_check.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/very_deep_check.py) and work the four
passes in Detail, in that order. The tool enumerates the scope — this
checkout's own top-level documents, plus the `practices/*.md` tree of every
source in force, resolved exactly the way
[tools/precedent_resolve.py](../tools/precedent_resolve.py) resolves them for
ordinary loading — and points at the passes (`--checklist` prints them in
full); reading and judging that scope is
the session's work, and is nearly the whole cost of this check. Never wired
into a commit, push, or merge gate — the mechanical audits and
[routing-audit](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/routing-audit.md) already cover what can be checked cheaply
and often; this covers what can only be judged, and is deliberately rare
because the judging is expensive.

**Scope is every Precedent repo in the session, not this checkout alone** —
this repo, each attached shared and individual source, and any consuming repo
the engine is vendored into. A finding is as likely to be in the seam
between two of them as inside any one, which is the reason they are read
together rather than one at a time.

**Every repo in force is also probed for whether THIS session can land work
in it, and every finding is grouped by the answer.** That is a different
question from the liveness gate below, which asks whether the *repository*
accepts work: a repo can be live, writable by its owner, and unreachable from
this container. The probe is a real `git push --dry-run` to an unused ref —
it changes nothing and the server answers before an object is written — so a
`HANDOFF` verdict is a quotable refusal rather than an inference from the
owner in the URL.

**Every branch is read for a verdict, and only the current copy is checked
and fixed.** This is the one check that reads every branch of every repo in
force, and it reads them for two answers only: did the branch's work land,
and should the branch go. Lints, checks and fixes (the FIX SWEEP included)
run on each repo's current copy, never on a side branch. One read reaches
further on purpose and reports without fixing: the CI fleet audit reads the
workflow files on branches pushed in the last seven days, because GitHub
runs a pushed branch's own workflows (Morgan, 2026-09-29, strength:
decided). The tier checks never read other
branches at all ([checks-follow-the-tier](checks-follow-the-tier.md)).

**A repo that needs a handoff stays in scope, deliberately.** Dropping it
would lose every finding in the seam between it and a repo still in scope,
which is the class this check exists for — a set's practice contradicting
universal's is a finding about both. What the verdict changes is the
*reporting*: a finding in a `LAND` repo ends in a commit from this session,
and one in a `HANDOFF` repo ends in a paste-ready prompt for a new session
([prompt-please](prompt-please.md)). Saying which is which before the reading
starts is the point; discovering it at the moment of trying to fix something
is the cost. `--landable-only` narrows scope for a deliberately cheap run and
says out loud what it made unreachable.

**The check reads its own GitHub API bill, and the account's, in its last
section** ([github-api-budget](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/github-api-budget.md)). What the run spent,
against a declared budget; what each allowance pool has left, read off the
headers of the calls it already made rather than bought with another one; and
plainly, as unmeasured rather than as clean, the allowances a session cannot
see from inside a container — `search`, at 30 requests a minute shared across
every window at once, and the secondary limit on creating content, which
nothing anywhere reports. **It reports and never refuses.** The pool is shared
by every session running, so a run that stopped because somebody else had
spent it would be punishing the wrong session; the remedy is fewer
simultaneous windows and cheaper tools, and neither is this tool's to apply.

**It also reads the other bill, the one that has actually been hurting.**
The `ACTIONS FLOOR` section counts, per workflow in every repo in force,
**runs × jobs over the window** — the run count from one application
programming interface (API) call with a `created` filter, the job count by
reading the workflow file. GitHub bills a whole minute per **job**, so that
product is the floor, and the floor was the entire cost in the case
[spec/CI_MINUTES_PLAN.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/spec/CI_MINUTES_PLAN.md)
item 15 measured: a 13-second job billed as a minute, 14 times a day, about
420 minutes a month with nothing misconfigured. **That number was found once,
by a session doing a one-off audit, and a number found once goes stale** —
this is the standing version. **A floor, never an invoice**: real minutes are
at least this, and whether they are billed at all depends on the repository
being private. The lever it makes visible is the one both item 13 and item 15
landed on independently — **job count per workflow**, because two workflows on
one pull request is two whole minutes for however little work. Added
2026-09-21 (Morgan, strength: decided) from
[spec/VERY_DEEP_CHECK_DEEPENING_PROPOSAL.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/spec/VERY_DEEP_CHECK_DEEPENING_PROPOSAL.md)
item 7.

**It ends with a review page for the person, published as an Artifact.**
Every run writes one page with three lists: **every branch the person can
delete**, in this checkout and every source, each with a link that opens
GitHub's branch list filtered to it; **every active practice, by
source**: universal first, then this repo's own, then the individual set,
then each shared set, each with its own one-line `index_clause`; and
**practices that may overlap** -- pairs whose wording reads alike, the same
slug in two sources, two rules alike across sources, or two alike within
one. A script finds the pairs and prints them in the run's MAY OVERLAP
lines; **the session judges every pair** -- merge them, and into which
source, or keep both and why -- and rewrites the page with `--verdicts`, so
each verdict sits beside its pair. Wording alone also matches rules that do
different jobs, which is why no pair is a finding until it is judged, and
why a pair judged different stays on the page with its reason. The same
section prints GENERATED FILES: tracked files a tool may write that
[tools/generated_files.json](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/generated_files.json)
does not list, for the session to list or to say why each is not generated.
[tools/precedent_review_page.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/precedent_review_page.py)
writes it under `.precedent/`, which git ignores, and the run's PRACTICE
CATALOGUE section calls it. Add the unlanded branches you judged safe to
delete, each with its reason, through `--recommend`. **Publish the page as
an Artifact, every run** -- the harness's Artifact tool, which keeps it
private to the person -- **never as an HTML file** attached to the reply or
sent with a file tool, **and never commit it, push it, or link it from a
repository**: it carries the private sets' practice text in full, which is
the point of it. Read the whole page before publishing it, as with any file
the session did not write. A harness with no Artifact tool says so in the
reply and names the file's path; that is the only time the file itself is
handed over. Nothing about the
practice catalogue is written into [spec/VERY_DEEP_CHECK.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/spec/VERY_DEEP_CHECK.md)
any more; the run's write-up links the page in the reply, not in a file.

Morgan, 2026-09-28 (strength: decided, "Go update"): *"do NOT put the list
of practices in the very deep check, and you can remove it now; BUT make an
artifact (NOT linked to from the github page), that [1] lists all those
branches I can delete, including a link I can click on for each and then
[2] lists ALL active practices, by repo, starting with universal, then the
individual, then the shared ones I have access to."* It replaced the
committed catalogue (added 2026-09-23), which a public repo had to hold the
private sets back from, so he never got the list he asked for.

**Read `main`, write through the landing branch.** The check judges the
version people are actually running, which is `main`: in every repo in
force, the run reads a working branch cut from `origin/main` (cut one if
the harness checked out something else). It changes nothing there
directly. Every fix is committed on that working branch and lands the
ordinary way, Booked (`Go update`) onto the person's landing branch and a Promote
from there, never pushed to `main`. **Reading `main` alone would re-find
what is already fixed and waiting to be promoted**, so the tool's
`LIVE VERSUS LANDING` section names, per repo, the files the landing
branch carries that are not live yet; before fixing a finding in one of
them, check whether the landing branch already did. Morgan, 2026-09-28
(strength: decided): *"it's better to do a deep check on the live version
(main), but we don't want to edit it, to edit it we should use the normal
process."* Until then a run read whatever the harness checked out --
`main` in one repo and `pre-staging` in four others, the same afternoon.

**Before anything is read, every repo in force must be provably current
against its origin, and must still be a repository work can land in** — this checkout and every attached source.
[tools/very_deep_check.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/very_deep_check.py) fetches and compares
each one as its first act and refuses to go further otherwise, because a
very deep check's whole product is judgment about what the repos say: a stale tree does not degrade
that judgment, it inverts it — work that landed last week reads as missing,
and bugs fixed days ago read as open. "Stale" and "cannot prove it isn't"
get the same verdict, since a confident wrong answer is the failure mode
either way. Fix it and start again; `--freshen` will fast-forward a clean
tree that is merely behind, and `--allow-stale` exists only for a
deliberately offline run, where every finding is then provisional.

**Current is not the same as alive**, and the second half is the one nothing
else here can see. Every repo in force is opened **automatically** — the
session-start hook clones each declared source, the freshness gate fetches
it, the refresh tool pulls it — so a source that has been **deleted,
renamed, or archived** is retried every session by machinery whose failures
are deliberately quiet. The check asks GitHub about each one, a single
call per repo: a deleted or access-revoked repository is re-cloned forever
and its failure reads like a credential problem, a renamed one keeps
resolving through a redirect that lasts only until somebody takes the old
name, and an **archived** one is the worst of the three — it clones,
fetches and reads exactly like a live repository and refuses every push, so
a session can spend its whole run editing a source nothing it writes can
ever land in. Ask with a credential or not at all: unauthenticated, a
private repository and a deleted one both answer *Not Found*, so the run
must say it learned nothing rather than report a repo as gone.

**A declared set that is RETIRED is reported in its own section, RETIRED
SETS**, for this checkout and every source in force: one that says so in
its `precedent-source.json`, or that the liveness call above found
archived. A set whose active rules are all in force elsewhere is a finding
with its one remedy, `python3 tools/precedent_vendor_engine.py drop-retired
.`, run in that repo on its feature branch and Booked onto its landing
branch like any other change; one still holding a rule found nowhere else
is a finding that names the rule, and stays declared. *Not Found* never
counts as retired. Morgan, 2026-10-06 (strength: decided): *"have update
vendors and very deep check see if any repos are declared to be included
that no longer exist and remove them"*, choosing to drop on a set's own
retirement or GitHub's archived flag, and never on *Not Found*.

**Current is not the same as CARRIED either, and that is the half nothing
else here could see.** The freshness gate proves a clone matches **its own
origin**. A repo can be perfectly current with itself and be running an
engine from three weeks ago, because a fix merged upstream reaches an
installed repo only when somebody goes there and runs `Update Vendors` —
and until 2026-09-21 nothing anywhere said which repos had not. **Measured
2026-09-20: 18 of 22 repositories had never taken one.** That is also the
structural reason this check had never once found a stale vendored tree:
not a gap in its passes, a gap in what any pass could see, since every pass
reads one repository against itself
([todo-2026-09-21-nothing-checks-a-consumer-against-upstream](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/todo/todo-2026-09-21-nothing-checks-a-consumer-against-upstream.md)).
The `CARRY-THROUGH` section asks it per repo in force: what it vendored,
where upstream is now, and how many engine files were added, changed or
**removed** since — removals by name, because a removal arriving on the next
refresh is the one that breaks something. **It reports and refreshes
nothing**: taking an update is `Update Vendors`, run in that repo, and it is
ordinary work authorized the ordinary way. **Scope is the repos this run
already opens**; the fleet version of the same question is
[chief-of-staff](chief-of-staff.md)'s. Added 2026-09-21 (Morgan, strength:
decided) from
[spec/VERY_DEEP_CHECK_DEEPENING_PROPOSAL.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/spec/VERY_DEEP_CHECK_DEEPENING_PROPOSAL.md)
item 3.

**Every declared shared and individual source must actually be present before
the check runs.** The ordinary loader tolerates a missing personal source and
says so on stderr — the right call for routine loading, where one operator's
absent individual set is expected. It is the wrong call here: a very deep
check is explicitly asked for and scoped to the whole set of repos in force,
so a silently dropped source defeats the reason it was asked.
[tools/very_deep_check.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/very_deep_check.py) fails loudly rather
than degrading. On that
failure, attach or clone the missing source (this harness's own
repo-attachment mechanism, or a plain `git clone`) and re-run — never re-run
with `--allow-missing-sources` to make the failure go away; that flag is for
the rare case where proceeding without the source is the actual intent (a
repo that deliberately has no shared set yet).

**The passes are ordered by what a miss costs, and that order governs fixing
too.** A from-scratch install or a migration that strands an adopter is a
roadblock; a heading capitalized two ways is not. Never let a pass-3 finding
queue ahead of a pass-1 one because it is easier to fix, and never report a
run as done with a pass-1 roadblock still open.

**Defaulting to the cheap half is not a smaller version of this check — it
is a different check, and the person asked for this one.** The mechanical
half (running the tool, running `verify_harness.py`/`precedent_check.py`/
`doc_lint.py`/`doc_sync.py`/`leak_gate.py`, reading what they print) finishes
in minutes because it costs the session nothing to run scripts. Passes 1 and
3, and the real half of pass 4 — rehearsing an install, reading the
catalogue and the branches by eye, judging rather than printing — are where
the 30-40 minutes a real run takes actually goes, and are the reason the
phrase exists rather than "run the checks." A session that quietly runs only
the mechanical half and records the rest as PARTIAL has followed the letter
of "never quietly skip a pass" above while missing the whole point: the
record being honest after the fact does not make the choice to narrow the
check one the person agreed to. **Say the scope out loud before running, not
in the write-up after** — either commit to the full four passes, or, if a
smaller run is the right call (a time-box, a narrow follow-up on what
changed since the last run), say so as the first line of the reply and let
the person confirm or widen it, the same way a time-box any run has used
before was always the person's own bound, stated up front, never the
session's quiet default.

**This is more than one session's work, and is meant to be split.** Keep the
run's state in [spec/VERY_DEEP_CHECK.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/spec/VERY_DEEP_CHECK.md): which
passes are done, what each turned up, what was fixed, what was deferred and
where it went. A later session resumes at the next unfinished pass rather
than starting over, and a pass is never quietly skipped — a pass deliberately
not run is recorded as not run, with the reason.

**Every run records what each of its parts returned and what each cost, and
reads them against the runs before it.** This check grew a section at a time,
each one added because a real run wanted it, and until 2026-09-11 nothing had
ever asked the reverse question: does any of them still earn its place?
[tools/very_deep_check.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/very_deep_check.py) appends every run to the
checked repo's own
[record/very-deep-check-ledger.json](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/record/very-deep-check-ledger.json)
— per section: what it found, what it printed, how long it took — and prints
the cross-run read at the end of each run. **The tokens it reports are what a
section PRINTED**, which is what it costs a session's context to read it, and
never the model's spend on judging that material, which no tool here can see.
The four passes are the expensive half and are the session's own measurement:
record each one as you finish it with `--record-pass`, findings and cost
included where you have them and left absent where you do not.

**A section that has come back empty across every recorded run gets a
decision, not a drift.** The run names those at the end, with three answers
and none of them automatic: **keep** it and say why here, **cheapen** it
(same check, less printed), or **retire** it — which means this practice's
Detail loses the bullet and
[decommission-deletes-files](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/decommission-deletes-files.md) applies to
whatever it owned. **Quiet is not the same as useless**: a guard that never
fires may be exactly why nothing is broken, and several of these sections
were written after one expensive incident they exist to prevent. Quiet is
also not the same as unmeasurable — a section that could not produce a count
is reported separately and is never graded as clean.

**A tier branch is never offered for deletion, by any list this check
prints or writes** — `pre-staging`, `staging`, `main`, staging's old name
`precedent-beta-v01`, and Promote's lock branch, in every repo in force,
merged or not. Every Promote fast-forwards the lower tiers, so an ancestor
test calls them "merged" right after one; until 2026-09-28 the sweep
protected only the declared base and the default branch, and would have
handed both `pre-staging` and `precedent-beta-v01` over with a one-click
delete link. Morgan, 2026-09-28 (strength: decided): *"it needs to never
never offer to delete pre-staging nor staging."* The guard sits in the one
function that mints every delete link, and a filtered page that would also
show a tier row says so on the row.

**When the branch this repo works on is not its base branch, the run reads
the base branch too — and reports it, never applies it.** Work pinned to a
long-lived integration branch stops looking at the base, and the base does
not stop moving: somebody fixes a bug there, or lands a document, and that
change is invisible to every session on the branch until the two are far
enough apart that reconciling them is its own project rather than a few
commits. [tools/very_deep_check.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/very_deep_check.py)
lists every commit on the base with no patch-equivalent on the branch — date,
subject, and the files it touched. **The session puts that list to the person
and asks, row by row, what should come across; it implements nothing on its
own** — not the whole list, and not the one row that looks obviously right.
Taking a change is ordinary work, authorized the ordinary way, and a run that
quietly merged the base would be doing the one thing pinning the work to a
branch was meant to prevent. **Some rows are deliberately not-carried**, and
the scan has no memory of that: a row declined last run is listed again next
run, so the decision belongs in the run record rather than in the tool.

Fix what a pass turns up in the same pass — most findings are small — then
re-run the mechanical audits, since the fixes themselves break links.
Anything deliberately left alone gets its own item under
[todo/](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/todo/TODO.md)
([spec/OPEN_ITEM_AND_GOTCHA_PLAN.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/spec/OPEN_ITEM_AND_GOTCHA_PLAN.md))
saying so, rather than being silently dropped.

**After work that invites drift** (a batch of practices added or
reordered, a practice that changed shape, an install into a new repo, a
merge that resolved conflicts across several shared files), **propose one;
never start it unasked.** It is expensive, and AGENTS.md keeps it to the
literal ask.

## Detail
**This is not `full-practice-audit` under another name — the two ask
different questions.** [full-practice-audit](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/full-practice-audit.md) asks,
practice by practice, "is this specific practice's Rule satisfied?" — a
closed question against one Rule at a time. The very deep check asks
questions no single practice's Rule can be checked against: does an adopter
who has only this repo actually get working? Do the mechanisms report what
they claim to? Does the repo's own writing still hold together? Each is a
property of the system *as a set*, which is exactly what a per-practice
sweep cannot see no matter how many times it runs.

Four passes, in order. Within each, the bullets are a starting point, not a
specification: report anything that makes the system harder to trust,
install, or follow, whether or not a bullet below names it. If a finding
recurs and nothing here names it, add a bullet so the next run looks for it
deliberately.

**Order of operations — mechanical before human, every time.** Judgment
spent on something a script already catches is judgment wasted, and a tree
already failing its own gates makes every later finding ambiguous: you
cannot tell a drift this run introduced from one that was there before. So:

1. **Prove every repo in force is current, and still there.** The tool's
   own first act, and a refusal rather than a warning — warning was tried and failed, because a
   session stale enough to need the warning has already been handed stale
   instructions to read it against. A source is the likelier offender: the
   session-start freshness guard runs for the session's primary repo only,
   so an attached sibling has never been checked by anything. The
   liveness half runs in the same breath and is a finding rather than a
   refusal: a deleted, renamed or archived repo in force does not make the
   reading below wrong, it makes the writing above it pointless. **And if
   the checkout moved under you here, re-read the instructions file**: a
   session is handed `AGENTS.md` before any guard can fast-forward the
   tree, so after a fast-forward the copy in context is the stale one
   (2026-09-14: 983 lines behind the tip, for a whole first turn).
2. **Run the deep check suite as it stands** — the five gates
   [AGENTS.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/AGENTS.md) names ([two-check-levels](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/two-check-levels.md))
   — and fix what it reports, before this check reads a line. `0 failed` and
   `0 violated` is the starting line, not the finish.

   **`verify_harness.py --all` here, not the bare command every other gate
   runs.** The push gate runs a 10% rotation of the planted cases per
   commit and promises the rest "within 10 commits" — a promise with no
   settlement date, because nothing anywhere ever forces the full set. This
   is the run that collects on it: the one moment in the project that is
   already expensive on purpose, and the one place a rotation that has
   quietly stopped covering something would surface. `--all` is the whole
   of the change, and
   [tools/very_deep_check.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/very_deep_check.py)'s
   `PLANTED CASE COVERAGE` section says on every run whether this invocation
   did it or still owes it; `--with-harness` runs it from inside the tool
   and records the result in the ledger like any other section. Added
   2026-09-21 (Morgan, strength: decided) from
   [spec/VERY_DEEP_CHECK_DEEPENING_PROPOSAL.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/spec/VERY_DEEP_CHECK_DEEPENING_PROPOSAL.md)
   item 11.
3. **Run [tools/very_deep_check.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/very_deep_check.py)** for the
   enumeration, the machine-readable parse, the source-shape check, the
   branch scan, the practice catalogue, and the GitHub API budget. A
   missing declared source stops the run here.
4. **Read the unmerged-branch inventory, before any pass begins.** Not the
   verdicts — those are pass 4's expensive half and stay there. Just the
   list, and enough of each branch's diff to know *what already exists
   somewhere*. This is the cheapest step in the whole check and the only
   one that prevents work rather than finding it: a fix written last week
   and never landed is invisible to every other step here, so a session
   that skips this rediscovers it from scratch, writes it up as a finding,
   and files it as open — three costs, all avoidable by reading one list
   first.
5. **Read the live-session sweep, before any pass begins**, for the same
   reason as step 4 and one step further out. The tool's LIVE SESSIONS
   section prints the repo half — what was pushed in the window, by whom,
   and what is sitting uncommitted in each clone. The other half is not
   mechanical and the section is not read until you have fetched it: ask
   the harness for this account's own sessions (its session-listing tool,
   then the per-session one for anything recent or still running) and hold
   each against those rows. **A session still RUNNING against a repo in
   force is the finding that changes what this run does next** — what you
   fix here it may overwrite, and what it is mid-way through reads here as
   half-done work — so it is worth knowing before the passes rather than
   during them. The rest of the reading is pass 4's.
6. **Ask for a real consumer repository, before starting pass 1.** Pass 1's
   highest-yield item needs one attached, and attaching is the person's act,
   not the session's — so the ask goes here, at the top, where an unanswered
   question still leaves time to work around it. Asked at the end it is not
   a question, it is a postponement. One sentence: name what it is for
   (updating its vendored tree to current and running its own gates), and
   carry on with everything else while it is outstanding.
7. **Then the passes, 1 through 4**, each ending with the suite from step 2
   re-run — the fixes a pass makes break links of their own. Whenever a
   pass turns up a gap, check it against step 4's inventory **before**
   writing it up: if a branch already fixes it, the finding is "this is
   written and unlanded", which is a different problem with a different
   remedy.
8. **Record each pass as you finish it, and read the component ledger
   last.** `--record-pass '<pass>=<status>,findings=N,tokens=N,note=…'`
   puts the expensive half's outcome and cost beside the tool's own
   sections; the cross-run read printed at the end of every run is then
   about the whole check rather than about its cheap half. Answer whatever
   it names as quiet — keep, cheapen, or retire — in the same run, in
   [spec/VERY_DEEP_CHECK.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/spec/VERY_DEEP_CHECK.md). A
   section left on that list across runs with no answer written down is the
   drift this step exists to stop.

The same rule holds inside a pass: where a mechanical check covers part of a
bullet, run it first and read only what it cannot see.

### Pass 1 — Can a new adopter get to a working install, and an existing one stay in one?
The highest-cost failures are here, because they strand someone outside this
session who cannot see what is wrong. Both halves of that sentence carry
weight: an install happens once, an **update** happens forever, and for a
long time only the first was ever tested. Reading the install documents finds
almost none of them: every significant finding of the 2026-09-06 pre-launch
audit came from **building the thing the document describes and running the
checks on it** ([spec/PRELAUNCH_AUDIT.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/spec/PRELAUNCH_AUDIT.md), "The
method"). Build the fixtures.

- **Rehearse each install path with fresh eyes, as the person it is
  written for.** Not a fixture built by the session that knows the
  documents: a session with no prior context — a subagent, told which
  document to follow, whom to play, and to report every point where the
  document is ambiguous, self-contradictory, names something that does not
  exist, or asks a question the person cannot answer, with path and line —
  one per path, in parallel. Five paths: the guided install
  ([SETUP.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/SETUP.md), as a non-technical administrator),
  the loader install ([INSTALL.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/INSTALL.md) §0, as a developer — both by
  running `tools/precedent_install.py` as an adopter would and by reading
  the numbered steps against what it did), the migration, the update
  below, and **a practice moved between levels**
  ([spec/MOVING_PRACTICES.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/spec/MOVING_PRACTICES.md)):
  two bootstrapped sets and a consumer in scratch, every direction the
  page offers (individual → shared, shared → individual, shared → universal,
  and universal → shared/individual, both halves — the initial duplicate
  landing and the deliberate `--dedupe-only --accept-reach-loss`
  withdrawal), with `tools/precedent_move.py` and, separately, by hand
  against the page's two steps — then the copy-and-delete the page
  forbids, to see which check names it. **And read what the move left
  behind elsewhere**: since 2026-09-28 the run that withdraws the source
  copy also fixes every current mention that still places the practice in
  the old set, in every repo in force, and names the sentences it could
  not fix; a rehearsal checks that a planted mention came out right and a
  dated one did not move. Added 2026-09-14, the day Morgan
  asked whether the run had tested it and it had not: the rehearsal
  returned thirteen findings and the move tool. The universal → shared/
  individual direction was added 2026-09-23, the same day a hand-done
  version of exactly that move (before the tool supported it) shipped a
  deduplication this repo's own consumer-fixture check later found
  resolving nowhere — rehearse it for the same reason the others are
  rehearsed: the tool having a `--help` line for something is not the
  same as the something working. Each rehearsal ends by running the result's
  own checks and reporting the real output. **Then ask one more question of each: is what
  landed what the pitch promised?** Read the result against
  [documentation/ADOPTING.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/documentation/ADOPTING.md) and the README, not
  only against the install document — on 2026-09-14 every sentence of the
  guided install was correct and the person following it received a
  system without the loader the pitch describes, which no single-document
  reading could see. Fresh eyes are what made the difference: the
  2026-09-14 run found 65 defects this way where the previous run's
  session-built fixtures found five.
- **A real from-scratch install.** A scratch repository with nothing in it,
  installed per [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/INSTALL.md) §0 against `main`
  alone — no shared set, no individual set, none of the sibling clones this
  session happens to have — following the documents exactly as written,
  without leaning on what this session already knows. Then run the deep
  check on the result. Anything the session had to work out that the
  documents did not say is a finding; so is any check that cannot come back
  clean on a correct fresh install.
- **A real migration**, the same way: a scratch repo on the classic
  `process/upstream/` layout, walked end to end through
  [spec/MIGRATING_EXISTING_INSTALLS.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/spec/MIGRATING_EXISTING_INSTALLS.md).
- **An update, not only an install.** Vendor a scratch consumer at an OLD
  upstream commit, then bring it forward to the current one with the
  documented tooling and run the checks. Every fixture above builds a repo
  that has never had to move, so nothing here ever exercised drift — and
  drift is where a consumer spends its whole life. This is the cheap half
  and it needs nobody's permission.
- **A DELETION, which is the direction nothing rehearsed until
  2026-09-21.** Every fixture above tests a repo RECEIVING something. A
  deletion is decided in one tree and executed in many, and for a long time
  the two vendoring paths did not even agree it happened: engine files
  diffed the manifest and propagated, CI workflow files waited for somebody
  to remember a tombstone, so **a template dropped without one stayed
  installed everywhere, forever, tracked by nothing.** The rehearsal is two
  assertions, not one — the file is gone, **and nothing left in that repo
  still names it.**

  The second is the half that bit. *(Found 2026-09-21: a refresh deleted
  `precedent-check.yml` from four practice sets. A second workflow in each
  had been paused hours earlier, its own header saying its checks now ran
  as steps in the file that was about to be deleted. The premise was true
  when written and false the same afternoon; two commit-scope checks ran
  nowhere and nothing reported it.)*
  [tools/precedent_vendor_engine.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/precedent_vendor_engine.py)
  now names every tracked file that still refers to something it just
  deleted — **it reports and never refuses**, since a document naming a
  retired file is usually right to.
- **What the NEXT refresh would take away, before it does.** The warning
  above arrives at the moment of deletion, which is the right time to be
  told and the wrong time to plan.
  [tools/very_deep_check.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/very_deep_check.py)'s
  `DELETIONS PENDING` section asks it early: per repo in force, what this
  checkout's **current** engine lists would remove from that repo on its
  next refresh, and which tracked files still name each one. **All three
  shipped paths, since 2026-09-22** — engine files, CI workflows and hooks —
  each with the same empty-source guard the removers themselves carry, since
  a source directory that globs to nothing means this checkout cannot see
  upstream rather than that upstream ships nothing. Read against
  the upstream's lists deliberately, never the consumer's own vendored
  copy, which may be months old. A row with referrers is a finding; a row
  without is a heads-up. Added 2026-09-21 (Morgan, strength: decided) from
  [spec/VERY_DEEP_CHECK_DEEPENING_PROPOSAL.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/spec/VERY_DEEP_CHECK_DEEPENING_PROPOSAL.md)
  items 1 and 2.
- **A REAL consumer repository, brought up to date.** Ask the person to
  attach one, early — see the order of operations, which puts the asking
  before pass 1 for the obvious reason that the answer may not come back.
  Then update its vendored tree to the current upstream, re-sync, and run
  its own gates. Where the scratch fixtures are clean rooms, this is the
  only step that meets what a real repo accumulates: a `visibility` nobody
  declared, an engine somebody mirrored by hand, prose that grew up
  referencing a private source, hundreds of commits of upstream drift, and
  a vendored copy of the update tool old enough to be dangerous.

  Do not treat this as optional garnish. On 2026-09-07 the scratch fixtures
  passed and one real consumer then produced seven defects in a row, four of
  them in mechanisms this run had built or fixed hours earlier — including
  one that had to be fixed twice because the second attempt failed with an
  identical message. The pre-launch audit had already named the gap it fills
  ("what is still missing is a real project: a scratch repository has no
  subject matter"); it stayed named and unfilled until somebody attached one.

  If no consumer can be attached, say so and record pass 1 as PARTIAL. Never
  let it pass on the fixtures alone — that is precisely the state that held
  while these seven defects were live.
- **The empty neighbourhood.** A brand-new person with no individual set; a
  team with no shared set yet; a consumer whose sources are declared but
  unreachable, as they are in every continuous integration (CI) checkout.
  Each degradation path should degrade with a named reason — never pass
  silently on a scan that never ran, and never fail on something the adopter
  cannot fix.
- **The generator, against the sets that already exist.** Run
  [tools/precedent_bootstrap_source.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/precedent_bootstrap_source.py)
  for each resolved shared and individual source and diff its output against
  the real set, file by file — the tool's `BOOTSTRAP DRIFT` section does
  this, and it needs those sets attached to do anything at all. A set is
  created once and then lived in for months while the generator keeps
  moving, so the two drift apart in both directions and nothing else here
  looks: `verify()` and the template-freshness scan both ask which files
  exist, never what any of them says. A difference in a file the skeleton
  ships is the set being used and is not a finding. A difference in a file
  bootstrap *generates* — the vendored engine, the session hooks,
  `settings.json` — is, and the set's own `ENGINE_MANIFEST.json` says which
  fix applies: refresh an older vendoring, or move a hand-edit upstream.
  **Without the sets attached this is a SKIP, not a pass** — the section
  says so in those words, and a run that leaves it skipped records pass 1
  as PARTIAL exactly as the real-consumer step above does.
- **The sets, against each other.** The step above and the two scans it
  names all measure *one set against one template*, so a change every set
  made identically reads as healthy in all of them — and that is the shape
  the drift actually takes, because a set is created from the template and
  then everybody who lives in one hits the same missing thing. The tool's
  `CONVERGENT DRIFT` section intersects the per-file differences the step
  above already computed and reports anything **two or more sets of a level
  changed the same way**, including in the skeleton-owned files that step
  deliberately downgrades to notes. Two sets is the threshold: one set is a
  person, two independent sets is a habit the template is missing.
  **It says which files converged; it does not say which side is right.**
  The sets may share a change the template should carry, or share an older
  build the generator has moved past, and the diff between one set and this
  checkout is what separates them — a finding that asserted the first would
  send somebody to copy a stale build upstream. An untracked file is
  container state, not a shape the skeleton is missing, and does not count.
  **A verdict, once a person has one, does not have to be re-argued on every
  run.** Each converged set may hold its own `very-deep-check-decisions.json`
  — one of four fixed verdicts, dated, with who decided and why, modeled on
  `identity.json`'s `grandfathered_commit_shas` — and when every set sharing
  a convergence has recorded the *same* verdict there, still live (no
  `revisit` date passed), the section prints `DECIDED` instead of reprinting
  the `FINDING` from zero. Disagreement between sets, a partial decision, or
  an expired `revisit` all still print the ordinary `FINDING`, annotated with
  what is already on record. A repo that holds no such file is unaffected —
  this is additive, never a gate (`VERY_DEEP_CHECK_DEDUP_LEDGER_PROPOSAL.md`,
  proposed by Morgan, 2026-09-20; Install section below).
- **Cross-repo relationships and permissions.** Walk who must be able to read
  or write what, for a *new* repo and a *new* person: the vendored engine,
  each declared source, approvers and CODEOWNERS, and the protected paths
  [spec/CONTRIBUTOR_ACCESS.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/spec/CONTRIBUTOR_ACCESS.md)
  describes. A step that works only because this session's operator already
  has access is a finding.
- **Everything unique to Claude Code, against the other three adapters.**
  This repository is developed in Claude Code, so a new mechanism is built
  as a `.claude/` hook and codex, gemini-cli and grok-build find out later
  or never. Read
  [templates/harness/PARALLELS.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/templates/harness/PARALLELS.md)
  row by row and ask of each cell the one thing its own check cannot:
  **is this verdict still true today?** `precedent_check.py`'s
  `claude-only-surface-has-a-parallel` guarantees only that every hook in
  `.claude/hooks/`, and every hook `.claude/settings*.json` wires, has a
  row with something written in all three columns — a `none because that
  harness has no pre-tool hook`, written while it genuinely had none, reads
  exactly like a current answer for as long as nobody looks. So look: check
  each harness's own current documentation for the invocation point the
  cell says is missing, and where one has appeared, the finding is that the
  mechanism should now transfer.

  **Then go the other way, which is the half a table cannot prompt you to
  do:** take each `.claude/` mechanism and open the artifact the row names
  as its parallel, rather than trusting the name. That is how the 2026-09-21
  run found the largest gap of the set — `templates/harness/README.md` had
  told three adapters for months to wire `tools/bootstrap.sh` as their
  equivalent of `session-start.sh`, and the script ran three of the hook's
  seven steps, so no non-Claude session had ever been handed
  `.precedent/SESSION_PRACTICES.md`, the file AGENTS.md's own Standing
  instruction tells every session to read. Nothing was lying; the two files
  had simply never been read side by side. Added 2026-09-21 at Morgan's
  request (strength: decided) — "check everything unique to Claude and make
  sure there's a parallel for the three others."
- **Not the practice simulation.** This pass installs real fixtures and runs
  the ordinary checks on them. It does not run
  [tools/precedent_simulate.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/precedent_simulate.py) or its
  siblings, which are deliberately never reachable from an occasion, gate, or
  hook ([spec/SIMULATION_BRIEF.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/spec/SIMULATION_BRIEF.md), "Never
  automatic") — this practice is not standing to run them either.

### Pass 2 — Do the mechanisms report what they claim to?
Every mechanical check, gate, and tool, one at a time. Every question below
found a real defect in a repo in force — most in the 2026-09-06 pre-launch
audit, the duplicate-implementation question in this practice's own
machinery, and the does-it-ever-run question in an attached source set —
and none of them is visible from a check's own output: a broken check reports
confidently.

1. **Does it scan only what this repo can act on?** Bucket every finding:
   *this repo wrote it* versus *this repo received it* (a vendored upstream
   tree, a materialized `practices/` directory, a file whose header says do
   not hand-edit, anybody's published history). A non-empty second bucket
   means the scope is wrong, not the content — and a check that produces
   permanently unactionable findings is one people learn to ignore, which
   costs more than the rule it protects. *(Found: 81 findings from one
   check, 12 from another, all inside vendored or materialized trees.)*
2. **Can it ever go green here?** Separately from scope: is there any state
   of this repository in which this check passes? Ask it of every gate a
   document calls mandatory. *(Found: a scrub gate at 116 failures no edit
   in the repo could clear, because the terms arrived from upstream — with
   its own instructions saying it must pass before any commit.)*
3. **Does anything named `--check`, `--dry-run`, or `--verify` write?**
   Snapshot the tree, run it, diff. Then run it again with a dependency
   deliberately unavailable and diff again. *(Found: `--check` rewrote three
   files on a clean tree, and deleted 57 tracked files when one source was
   unreachable, while printing a check verdict — after weeks in the
   documented session-start sequence.)*
4. **Does a tool's output depend on the state of its own output directory?**
   For anything that deletes and rewrites a directory: does it read that
   directory while deciding what to write? Run it twice and diff; then
   delete the output directory, run once, and compare. *(Found: link
   rewriting asked the filesystem about a file the same run was about to
   write, so a practice's citation of its own check script became an
   absolute URL into a private repo.)*
5. **Would a generated name disclose what the architecture hides?** Wherever
   a tool mints a URL, path, or name, ask what it reveals and to whom — then
   check whether the consuming repo is public. *(Found: exactly the private-
   repo URL above, minted into a tracked tree in a public repo, for a source
   the resolver refuses to let a shared config even name.)*
6. **Is a file the format it claims?** Parse with a real third-party parser,
   never the repo's own reader, which is more permissive than the standard
   and so never notices.
   [tools/very_deep_check.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/very_deep_check.py) now does this for
   every tracked JSON and YAML file; what stays a judgment call is every other
   declared format — a schema, a fenced block, a manifest — that no parser
   here covers. *(Found: 10 practice files and 4 decision records PyYAML
   rejects; the in-house reader took everything after the first colon and
   was happy.)*
7. **Do string matches respect name boundaries?** Every blocklist, denylist,
   and retired-term list: test each term against a plausible compound.
   *(Found: retired term `pack_sync` matching `voice_pack_sync.py`, a live
   tool — nothing could satisfy the finding but renaming a real file.)*
8. **Are there two of anything that should be one -- any needless
   redundancy?** Two scripts doing the same job, two implementations of one
   rule, a helper copied instead of imported, a constant list maintained in
   two files, a check and a gate testing the same property, two checks
   scanning for the same thing, two practices saying one rule, a document
   restating a spec it could link. **The tool's `SECOND LISTS OF PRACTICES`
   section is this question's mechanical half:** it names every hand-kept
   file that lists most of the catalogue by slug, and a reader decides
   whether each is a generated view (fine) or a copy that can drift. *(Found
   2026-09-29, both missed by earlier runs of this question: a hand-kept list
   of every practice's routing reason, whose copy of the gates had drifted
   on fourteen practices, and two checks scanning for retired words, one
   with history-aware rules and one without. Morgan, that day: add a check
   for needless redundancy -- this is it, widened, rather than a second
   pass that would itself be the redundancy.)* Copies do not stay identical: one gets fixed
   and the other goes on being wrong, and the stale one is as likely as not
   to be the one actually running. Search by what code *does*, not by what
   it is called ([search-by-purpose](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/search-by-purpose.md) is the same
   search) — a duplicate that shared a name would have been noticed
   already. For each, name which copy is canonical and delete or re-point
   the other. Vendoring is the deliberate exception: the engine is copied
   into consuming repos on purpose, so the question there is whether every
   copy came from
   [tools/precedent_vendor_engine.py](../tools/precedent_vendor_engine.py)
   with a recorded commit, never whether a copy exists. *(Found: this
   practice's own checklist, living both in the Detail section below and as
   a `CHECKLIST` string literal inside
   [tools/very_deep_check.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/very_deep_check.py), with nothing
   keeping the two in step — the tool printed the copy, so a session would
   have worked the stale list without ever seeing the current one.)*
8a. **Is every key a repo DECLARES actually read by something?** The
    mirror of question 8 one level over: that one asks whether two things
    do one job, this asks whether a declared thing does any job at all.
    **A key nobody reads is not a typo, it is a belief** — somebody wrote
    it expecting an effect, and the file goes on looking exactly as
    intentional as a live one, forever.
    [tools/very_deep_check.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/very_deep_check.py)'s
    `CONFIG KEYS` section lists every key in every `precedent.json` and
    `identity.json` in force against every script the repo carries.

    *(The incident:
    [spec/CI_MINUTES_PLAN.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/spec/CI_MINUTES_PLAN.md)
    item 15 told a session to set `ci_workflows: disabled` in a consuming
    repo's `precedent.json` and then delete a workflow. `ci_preference()`
    resolves that key from a SOURCE's `identity.json` and never from a
    consumer's `precedent.json`, so the key would have been read by
    nothing and the deletion would have carried a commit message claiming
    a toggle permitted it. A session read the engine and refused.)*

    **Two things keep it honest.** The corpus is every script a repo
    carries — tools, hooks, bootstrap, shipped templates — because a key is
    consumed by whatever runs, in whatever language: scoped to `tools/*.py`
    alone, its first run reported `stale_checkout_hours` as unread, and it
    is read by `freshness-guard.sh`. And **read by nothing HERE is not read
    by nothing**: where a key has no local reader the row names which other
    repo in force mentions it, since a private check may legitimately run
    against every repo. Mentioned nowhere at all is the row worth an
    answer. Added 2026-09-21 (Morgan, strength: decided) from
    [spec/VERY_DEEP_CHECK_DEEPENING_PROPOSAL.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/spec/VERY_DEEP_CHECK_DEEPENING_PROPOSAL.md)
    item 10.

8b. **For every class of artifact this repo SHIPS, does an addition reach
    an installed repo? A change? A deletion?** Three columns, one row per
    class, re-answered on every run. The question exists because the two
    vendoring paths disagreed for months and **nobody had asked it of both
    at once**: engine files diffed the manifest and propagated a deletion,
    CI workflow files waited for somebody to remember a tombstone, so a
    template dropped without one stayed installed in every repository
    forever, tracked by nothing. That was found on 2026-09-21 by asking,
    and fixed the same day.

    **The answers as of 2026-09-21, updated 2026-09-28** — a rule about a mechanism carries its
    date ([volatile-rules-carry-dates](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/volatile-rules-carry-dates.md)), and
    each cell is a claim to re-verify in the code rather than to inherit:

    | Shipped class | Addition arrives | Change arrives | Deletion arrives |
    |---|---|---|---|
    | Engine files (`tools/`) | yes | yes | **yes** — manifest diff |
    | CI workflow files | yes | yes | **yes**, since 2026-09-21 — manifest diff, with tombstones kept for what a diff cannot express (a rename) |
    | Hooks (`.claude/hooks/`) | **yes**, since 2026-09-25 — `HOOK_WIRING` adds the `settings.json` entry for a hook the repo's kind gets (add-only; a repo may decline it in `precedent.json`) | yes | **yes**, since 2026-09-22 — the third removal path, keyed on what upstream ships; it read the already-rewritten manifest and removed nothing until 2026-09-28, when it began reading the record from before the update |
    | `settings.json` itself | yes, add-only hook entries, since 2026-09-25 | no | no |
    | The practice catalogue | yes — materialized per session | yes | yes |
    | Skeleton / bootstrap templates | only into a newly created set | only into a new set | only into a new set — existing sets drift, which `BOOTSTRAP DRIFT` reports |
    | Vocabulary | yes — derived at render time | yes | yes |

    **That last cell read `NO` when this item was first asked**, on
    2026-09-21, and it was the item's first finding: there were exactly two
    removal paths, for engine files and CI workflows, and none for hooks. A
    hook dropped upstream stayed installed in every consumer — and worse
    than the CI case, since `_write_hook_files` then replaced `hook_files`
    with only what it had just written, so **the manifest entry vanished
    too** and the file went on running, in every session, recorded by
    nothing. **Fixed 2026-09-22** by `_remove_dropped_hook_files`
    ([todo-2026-09-21-a-dropped-hook-never-leaves-a-consumer](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/todo/todo-2026-09-21-a-dropped-hook-never-leaves-a-consumer.md)),
    which is why the row now reads yes and carries the date it changed.
    **The question outliving the answer is the point of the table**: a cell
    is re-read, not inherited.
    Added 2026-09-21 (Morgan, strength: decided) from
    [spec/VERY_DEEP_CHECK_DEEPENING_PROPOSAL.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/spec/VERY_DEEP_CHECK_DEEPENING_PROPOSAL.md)
    item 4.

9. **Does anything use alphabetical order to pick a winner?** Often the
   previous question's duplicate, one layer on: where two candidates could
   satisfy a lookup — two directories, two copies of a file, two sources for
   a slug — find what breaks the tie. If it is `sorted()`, it
   is an accident that will pick differently the next time a name changes.
   *(Found twice: a check script present in both its source and its
   materialized location, needing different `ROOT` depths, with the wrong one
   winning every time — two checks confidently reporting that files in plain
   view did not exist.)*
10. **Does a rule forbid the only mechanism the project ships for it?** For
    each rule, ask how a correctly-installed repo satisfies it, then check
    that the sanctioned tool actually produces that state. *(Found: a rule
    against duplicated engine code, in a project whose own vendoring tool
    makes exactly those copies — every correct install permanently in
    violation.)*
11. **Read each enforced practice's check against its own Rule.** The full
    practice audit prints an enforced practice as a single line, on the
    reasoning that its check either fired or it did not — and questions 1-9
    are precisely the ways that reasoning fails. This is the only pass that
    ever looks at those checks, so look: does the check test what the Rule
    says, all of what it says, and nothing the Rule does not ask for?
12. **Is each "known exception" still true?** Reproduce every documented
    gotcha, known-issue note, and "this currently fails because" claim. These
    are written once and re-tested never, and a stale one is worse than none:
    it teaches the next session to skip a check that now works. *(Found: a
    gotcha describing a `ROOT` bug fixed weeks earlier, still telling
    sessions to work around it.)* What happens to each verdict -- close,
    record, ask -- is Pass 4's open-item and gotcha review.
13. **What does a session inherit that a person configured by hand?** List
    every `git config`, environment variable, user-level config file, and
    sibling clone this session or a recent one set up or relied on. Each is
    something the next session will not have; anything load-bearing belongs
    in a hook or a checked-in file. *(Found: commit identity unset in four
    clones, so commits landed under the wrong author and tripped the repo's
    own check.)*
13a. **Read the commits that LANDED, not only the configuration.**
    Question 13 asks what a session *inherits*; nothing asked what actually
    landed, which is the only place the answer shows.
    [tools/very_deep_check.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/very_deep_check.py)'s
    `IDENTITY REALITY` section reads three things per repo in force: the
    **author of every commit in the window** against the declared identity;
    the **author-date offset** against the declared timezone at that
    instant — the field `commit-identity.sh` either enforces or merely
    guesses at, so drift there is a past-tense wrong guess nobody saw; and
    any **tracked `settings.json` hardcoding `GIT_AUTHOR_*`**, which
    `no-hardcoded-git-identity` already catches in a repo that runs
    `precedent_check.py` and which was actually found in a consumer, by
    hand, by a session that happened to look.

    **A commit by somebody else is a note, never a finding** — other people
    and machines commit here, and a check that called that wrong would be
    unusable. What is a finding is a commit authored by *nobody in
    particular*: the address a container invents when nothing configured
    one. *(First run, 2026-09-21: 17 commits in the window carrying a
    `+00:00` author date and 8 carrying `-04:00`, against 275 at the
    declared `-03:00` — the enforcement not having reached the sessions
    that made them.)* Added 2026-09-21 (Morgan, strength: decided) from
    [spec/VERY_DEEP_CHECK_DEEPENING_PROPOSAL.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/spec/VERY_DEEP_CHECK_DEEPENING_PROPOSAL.md)
    item 8, after three identity incidents in six days.

14. **Does a verification enumerate, or does it sample?** For any check
    whose failure mode is something *absent* — a file, a term, a link, a
    row, a practice — ask how it concluded nothing was missing. If it can
    name the items it looked at, it is reporting its own coverage and not
    the property: **a sample proves presence and can never prove absence.**
    Worse, the items a session reaches for are the ones it has just been
    working on, which is systematically the class that cannot fail. Rebuild
    it as a set difference — the whole expected set, the whole actual set,
    report everything in the first and not the second — and where the whole
    set genuinely cannot be enumerated, say the check is partial rather
    than letting a clean sample read as a clean result. *(Found: a
    rehearsal of the phase-7 merge-back simulated the merge, checked that
    two files survived it, and recorded that the revert trap "was checked
    and does not fire". Both files had been edited by that same session
    days before, which is exactly what put them in the surviving class. The
    set difference, run against the whole tree the next day, was 507
    files.)*
15. **Does it ever run here?** Question 2 asks whether a check can ever go
    green; this asks whether it fires at all, and the two look nothing alike.
    A check that cannot pass is loudly red. A check that never runs prints
    `SKIPPED` with an honest reason and is then aggregated by nothing — a
    mechanism telling the exact truth to nobody, which is the one shape this
    pass would otherwise let through. Enumerate rather than sample (question
    14 is the same discipline): for **every registered check, in every repo in
    force**, record what it actually did — passed, violated, skipped and why,
    or never registered there at all — then read each practice's `checked_by`
    against that result. A `checked_by` naming a check that never runs in the
    repo holding it is a coverage claim nobody tested, which is the state
    [tools/precedent_check.py](../tools/precedent_check.py)'s own header says
    the module exists to end.

    **What comes out is a coverage report, not a deletion list**, and the
    distinction is the whole of it: *"this rule never fires"* bundles three
    unlike states, and only one is evidence about the rule. **The check never
    ran** says nothing at all — remove on that and you remove a rule *because*
    nobody checked it. **The check runs and always passes** cannot separate an
    obeyed rule from an unnecessary one; they are identical from the output.
    **There is no check at all** is most of the catalogue by design, where
    "firing" was never defined. Removal stays a person's judgment, now with
    evidence under it. Three readings earn a line where you find them: a
    `checked_by` naming a check that never runs there; a check that runs
    everywhere, has never fired **and** forbids something no longer
    structurally possible — the only retirement candidate of the three; and a
    check firing repeatedly on one root cause, which asks for a fix to the
    tooling rather than more enforcement of the rule. *(Found: a shared source
    at 12 passed and 42 skipped, every skip the same cause — each check is
    keyed to a `practices/<slug>.md` the set does not carry, because a source
    set's `practices/` holds its own level only and it resolves no source that
    could supply the rest. Among the 42 was the rule governing what a practice
    file may link relatively. That set had published a relative link to a file
    materialization does not copy — live where it was written, dead in every
    repository that received the catalogue — and a consuming repo caught it one
    sync late, because the rule is in force there and skips in the set that
    published the violation. The same skip hid
    [generated-artifact-provenance](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/generated-artifact-provenance.md), whose
    own file names a check for it.)*
15a. **And the enumeration itself, per repo, mechanically.** Question 15
    says to enumerate rather than sample, for every registered check in
    every repo in force — a read nobody could finish by hand, one repo's
    output at a time with the comparison held in a session's head.
    [tools/very_deep_check.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/very_deep_check.py)'s
    `CHECK COVERAGE` section runs **each repo's own vendored copy** of
    `precedent_check.py --full-sweep` — the engine that actually runs
    there, not this checkout's — and reports passed, violated and skipped,
    **grouped by the CAUSE of the skips**.

    **The grouping is the whole finding.** Forty skips behind one
    structural reason is a coverage hole wearing forty names; forty behind
    forty reasons is housekeeping. The slug is normalised out of each
    reason for exactly that purpose — reporting `no practices/<a>.md`,
    `no practices/<b>.md` … separately is the shape that hid this in the
    first place. *(First run, 2026-09-21: a shared source at 17 passed and
    53 skipped, **44 of the 53 for one cause** — each check keyed to a
    `practices/<slug>.md` a source set does not carry, because its
    `practices/` holds its own level only.)* Added 2026-09-21 (Morgan,
    strength: decided) from
    [spec/VERY_DEEP_CHECK_DEEPENING_PROPOSAL.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/spec/VERY_DEEP_CHECK_DEEPENING_PROPOSAL.md)
    item 13.

16. **Is a boundary a setting or a document?** A rule that says *a
    contributor cannot change X* is enforced by a setting somewhere -- a
    branch-protection rule, a `CODEOWNERS` file GitHub actually reads, a
    role on an invitation -- or it is a sentence. For each boundary a repo
    in force describes, name the setting that enforces it and **read that
    setting**, never the document describing it. Where the file that
    carries the boundary is generated (a `CODEOWNERS` from a registry),
    check the generated copy against its source: a hand-edit there is the
    boundary changing with nothing announcing it.
    [tools/very_deep_check.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/very_deep_check.py)'s
    `CONTRIBUTOR BOUNDARY` section does both per repo in force and prints
    `UNVERIFIED` rather than a pass when it could not ask GitHub -- which is
    the answer a session without a token that can read protection settings
    gets, and it is not the same answer as *off*. *(Found: the contributor
    boundary in
    [spec/CONTRIBUTOR_ACCESS.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/spec/CONTRIBUTOR_ACCESS.md)
    described in three documents and enforced by a setting nothing had ever
    read -- a forgotten instantiation step would have left Write as
    unrestricted write while every document still described a wall,
    2026-09-14.)*
17. **Does the harness-adapter ledger's verdict match what each member's own
    documentation actually tells its user?** `parallel-artifact-ledger`'s
    enforced check
    ([tools/precedent_check.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/precedent_check.py))
    only proves a row EXISTS for every commit that touched a harness-adapter
    member -- its own docstring says so: "whether a referenced row is
    actually CORRECT ... only that a row exists." This is the ledger's own
    version of question 15's gap between a check running and a check's
    claim being true, so it gets the same treatment: read a sample of
    rows, newest first, against the real state of each named member. Where
    a row claims a mechanism transferred, does the named file actually
    carry it. Where a row claims a workaround "needs no harness at all" and
    a member without a hook mechanism could still get it by running a
    script once by hand, does that member's own README say so anywhere a
    person reading it would find it -- or does the workaround live only in
    the ledger row's own prose, reachable by nobody who starts from the
    adapter they actually use. Every family member with an adapter
    directory gets read this way, present tense: today that is
    `claude-code/`, `codex/`, `gemini-cli/`, and `grok-build/`. All four
    carry ledger rows since 2026-09-21. grok-build's hooks syntax is still
    unverified against xAI's docs, so its rows record verdicts, not wiring:
    read them like the others, and confirm the unverified-hooks caveat in
    [templates/harness/grok-build/README.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/templates/harness/grok-build/README.md)
    still holds. A fifth member joins the full read the day it gets a directory
    of its own -- there is nothing to check for one that does not exist
    yet, which is a finding this pass should say plainly rather than
    passing over in silence. *(Found, 2026-09-17: `templates/harness/LEDGER.md`'s `ffcae058`
    row, and two rows above it for the same file, each say a codex or
    gemini-cli user could get the fix by running `commit-identity.sh` once
    by hand -- `commit.gpgsign false`, the global commit identity, the
    timezone symlink, none of which need a hook mechanism neither member
    has. Neither `templates/harness/codex/README.md` nor
    `templates/harness/gemini-cli/GEMINI.md` mentioned this anywhere; the
    workaround was written down exactly once, in
    [documentation/CLOUD_SETUP.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/documentation/CLOUD_SETUP.md),
    framed entirely as a Claude Code Remote concern. A codex or gemini-cli
    user reading their own adapter's README had no way to discover it.
    Closed the same session by pointing both READMEs at that section.)*
18. **Read every CI WORKFLOW FILES OUTSIDE VENDORING candidate this run's
    own mechanical section prints, one at a time.** That section enumerates
    by content tracking (a repo's own `ci_workflow_files`), never by
    matching a name against a list — it hands you candidates, not a
    verdict, and reading each one is this pass's own job, not something the
    mechanical half can finish for you. Open the file, read what it
    actually runs, and compare that against what the repo's vendored
    template provides before concluding anything. **Never classify one as
    orphaned by its filename alone** — that is exactly the mistake the
    incident below made, one pass before this item existed to stop it.
    *(Found, 2026-09-20: a sweep list built by matching filenames against
    [spec/CI_MINUTES_PLAN.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/spec/CI_MINUTES_PLAN.md)'s own table of
    retired-workflow names flagged `light-check.yml` in a real dependent
    repo as a retired duplicate of `bestpractice-docs.yml`.
    Verified directly, not relayed: it was a live, required, hand-authored
    check — `tools/light_check.py`, that repo's own `two-check-levels`
    light check — sharing a name with something Precedent once shipped and
    later retired, for reasons that had nothing to do with each other. The
    eleven-repo sweep the same finding was about to authorize would have
    repeated this on every remaining name match, unverified.)*

19. **Read what GITHUB says about each workflow file, not what the tree
    says.** Item 18 reads the workflow FILES; this asks the platform, and
    the gap between the two is a class nothing else here can see. A file
    GitHub's parser refuses is **not a red run — it is no run**, so the
    branch reads as having no continuous integration (CI) rather than
    broken CI. Actions switched off looks, from the tracked tree, exactly
    like working CI. A trigger that stopped matching looks like nothing at
    all.
    [tools/very_deep_check.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/very_deep_check.py)'s
    `WORKFLOW REALITY` section asks four questions per file — registered
    with Actions at all, state active, when it last ran, and whether that
    run postdates the file's newest commit — and reports `UNVERIFIED`
    rather than a pass wherever it could not ask. **Two limits are printed,
    never assumed away**: GitHub lists workflows from the DEFAULT branch, so
    a file absent from the listing is a finding only when it is also on that
    branch; and a workflow that has never run cannot be told apart from
    Actions being off by that endpoint alone, which is why the disabled case
    is read off the listing call's own refusal instead
    ([the permissions endpoint is unreachable from a session](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/gotchas/gotcha-2026-09-21-actions-permissions-are-unreadable-from-a-session.md)).

    **The offline half is now an enforced check and is not this pass's
    work**: `workflow-yaml-github-can-parse`
    ([tools/precedent_check.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/precedent_check.py))
    refuses a YAML merge key (`<<:`) in any workflow file or shipped
    workflow template (it refused every anchor and alias until 2026-09-28,
    when a very deep check found GitHub had accepted plain ones since
    2025-09-18), through PyYAML's own event stream where PyYAML is installed
    and a structural line match where it is not — **CI has no PyYAML, so
    the first version of that check skipped in the one environment that
    gates every pull request**, which is not a check
    ([upstream-fix](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/upstream-fix.md), point 7). *(Found 2026-09-21: an anchor shared one `paths:` list
    between a `push:` and a `pull_request:` trigger. PyYAML resolved it —
    including through the exact command this repository's own templates
    recommend — and GitHub rejects the file outright. Every local
    verification this project teaches would have passed it.)* Added
    2026-09-21 (Morgan, strength: decided) from
    [spec/VERY_DEEP_CHECK_DEEPENING_PROPOSAL.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/spec/VERY_DEEP_CHECK_DEEPENING_PROPOSAL.md)
    item 5.

20. **Every incident filed since the last run, asked what now catches it.**
    This pass's closing item, and the one that makes the check grow itself
    instead of growing whenever somebody happens to notice a gap. Take
    every gotcha filed and every open item closed since the last recorded
    run —
    [tools/very_deep_check.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/very_deep_check.py)'s
    `INCIDENT COVERAGE` section reads the date off the ledger and assembles
    the list, with whatever in `tools/` or `practices/` cites each slug —
    and ask of each **one** question: what prevents a recurrence, and is
    there a planted case proving it fires?

    **Three answers are honest, and the third is the one worth writing
    down**: a named check with a planted case; a named check with no
    planted case (file one); and **nothing, deliberately, because the class
    is not mechanically detectable**. A gap somebody examined and declined
    is a different state from a gap nobody has looked at, and only a
    written answer tells them apart.

    **A citation is not coverage.** The section enumerates and cites; it
    never judges, because a docstring naming an incident reads exactly like
    a check testing for one. What it removes is the part nobody does, which
    is assembling the list. *(Its first run, 2026-09-21, found four of the
    six gotchas filed that week cited by nothing in `tools/` or
    `practices/` at all.)* Added 2026-09-21 (Morgan, strength: decided)
    from
    [spec/VERY_DEEP_CHECK_DEEPENING_PROPOSAL.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/spec/VERY_DEEP_CHECK_DEEPENING_PROPOSAL.md)
    item 12.

21. **Every detector built since the last run, carried to every repo in
    force.** [upstream-fix](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/upstream-fix.md)
    says fix the origin and then every copy (point 8). **Nothing checked that the
    second half happened**, and the failure is quiet by construction: a
    consumer running the engine it vendored before the fix reports nothing,
    correctly, and its silence reads exactly like a clean result.
    [tools/very_deep_check.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/very_deep_check.py)'s
    `FIX SWEEP` section takes every check registered here since the ledger's
    last run and runs **this checkout's** copy of it against **every** repo
    in force.

    **It is the mirror of item 15a beside it, and the two are easy to
    confuse.** `CHECK COVERAGE` runs each repo's **own** vendored engine,
    because what a consumer actually enforces is the code it has. This runs
    **this** engine against that repo's tree, because the whole point is a
    detector the consumer has not vendored yet.

    **A VIOLATION here is the case the item exists for**, and it is fixed in
    the run that found it. The incident: the hardcoded-identity check was
    written the day the trap was reported, in this repository, and the
    repository that actually had the problem was a consumer nobody
    re-scanned. **A check built in response to an incident and never run
    where the incident happened is the most expensive kind of clean
    result.**

    **Three limits, all printed beside the rows.** It sweeps registered
    checks only — a detector that shipped as a standalone tool, a planted
    harness case or a hook is not reached. Each repo is read as a
    one-commit copy, so a change-scope check has no change to look at and
    declines, correctly, since another repo's tree cannot answer a question
    about this one's diff. And a depth-limited clone may hold no commit
    before the ledger's date, in which case the comparison runs from the
    oldest commit it has and **under-reports** — the narrower window is
    named in the output rather than silently applied. Added 2026-09-22
    (Morgan, strength: decided — *"Build item 13's fix-sweep half, go
    update"*) from
    [spec/VERY_DEEP_CHECK_DEEPENING_PROPOSAL.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/spec/VERY_DEEP_CHECK_DEEPENING_PROPOSAL.md)
    item 13.

22. **Read the CI FLEET AUDIT: every workflow on every branch of every
    repo, as GitHub sees it.**
    [tools/ci_fleet_audit.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/ci_fleet_audit.py)
    asks GitHub, not the clone. Items 18 and 19 read the files in the
    trees on disk. This one sees what never passes a session's push gate:
    a workflow edited on GitHub's website, one written through the GitHub
    API, one sitting on an active side branch (GitHub runs a branch's own
    workflow files when that branch is pushed), and one in a repo that
    does not use Precedent. A side branch with no commit in 7 days is
    counted and not read: it runs nothing until pushed, and a push makes it
    active for the next run. For each workflow it prints when it runs, whether it is
    approved at its exact content
    ([ci-workflow-approved](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/ci-workflow-approved.md)),
    and GitHub's run count over 30 days by event. A schedule shows among a
    workflow's triggers. It runs only here and by hand, never on a schedule
    of its own (Morgan, 2026-09-26: "I only want this to run when either
    manually invoked or as part of a very deep check").

    **Its output stays in the session.** It names other repositories, so it
    never goes into a repo, an issue or a pull request (Morgan, 2026-09-26,
    strength: decided: *"its results should go to the session not the
    GitHub since it references other repos of yours"*).

    **Each FINDING is money spent without anyone deciding to.** Show the
    person the workflow and when it runs, then approve it in their words,
    change it, or delete it. A stale side branch that still carries a
    push-triggered workflow is a finding too: say whether it can be
    deleted, with the one-click link
    ([never-delete-a-remote-branch](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/never-delete-a-remote-branch.md)).

    **NOT REACHED is not clean.** Inside a session GitHub answers only for
    the repos attached to it (measured 2026-09-26), so the list of repos
    not reached is part of the result, and it says what would reach each
    one.
23. **Does a consumer receive anything it has no use for, or anything
    twice?** The tool's `VENDORED SURPLUS` section is this question's
    mechanical half, asked from both ends. From this repo: everything it
    ships by either route, the catalogue copy into `process/upstream/` and
    the engine into a consumer's own `tools/` and `.claude/hooks/`, with
    every file shipped twice and every file nothing else that ships names.
    From each consumer in the session: what its copy still holds that the
    copy no longer carries, and every file it holds twice. **Judge each
    one:** narrow what ships (a rule in `VENDORING_RULES`, the ruleset
    [vendor-rollout-disclosed](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/vendor-rollout-disclosed.md)'s fifth question
    applies to every new file), or say why the consumer needs it. The consumer
    side clears itself on its next Update Vendors. *(Found 2026-09-30: a
    consumer's copy held 543 files, among them this repo's test suite, its
    gotchas and a second copy of the engine. Question 8 never saw it: it
    reads one repo against itself, and the section before this one checked
    only the checkout the run started in, against a list of what to leave
    out, so anything not on that list read as fine. Morgan, that day:
    "check specifically the vendored-in files to see if anything is
    vendored-in that the consumer repo would never have use of." Its first
    run flagged the Claude Code hooks, installed and again in the copy's
    templates. Morgan kept them: the template is what a new repo is made
    from. A template beside the file made from it is now counted, not
    flagged.)*

### Pass 3 — Does the writing still hold together?
The coherence read, across every repo in scope. Run the mechanical audits
first so this pass spends its attention on what they cannot see.

- **A close read of every always-loaded instructions file, against
  reality.** `AGENTS.md` and its siblings in every repo in scope, read
  line by line and asked four questions: **does this still describe
  something that exists**; **is it still needed**; **is it saying it the
  long way**; and **is it duplicating a rule that now lives somewhere
  else**. This is the one document every session reads before doing
  anything, so a sentence that has quietly stopped being true costs more
  here than anywhere else in the tree.

  Added 2026-09-21 (Morgan, strength: decided) after an Update Vendors
  pass found a consuming repo's `AGENTS.md` naming a repository that does
  not exist — a private voice-definition repository under its old name,
  twice, after the real one had been renamed, in the session-start step and
  again in a tool's description. **The file's own step 1 warns about exactly that failure**:
  a source name going stale silently. A document that describes its own
  failure mode and then exhibits it twice is what an unread instruction
  file looks like from the inside.

  **The checkable half is not read — it is asked.** Every `owner/repo`
  string in those files is probed against GitHub by this tool's own
  `instruction-file repo references` section, which runs beside the
  repos-in-force audit and shares its API call: a name already asked about
  as a source is never asked twice. A name that does not resolve is a
  finding; a name that answers under a DIFFERENT full name has been renamed,
  which is the more dangerous one, because the old name keeps working
  through a redirect that lasts only until somebody takes it. Read that
  section's output; do not re-read the file looking for what it already
  answered.

  **A rename is fixed in the run, not only reported** (Morgan, 2026-09-29,
  strength: decided). The repository-visibility audit already asks GitHub
  about every repository named anywhere in this checkout's tracked text; it
  now also asks about the names in every source's own tree, and any answer
  under a different full name -- from that audit, this one, or the
  repos-in-force audit -- goes to `fix_repo_renames()`, which repoints the
  clone's `origin` and rewrites every current reference in every repo in
  force, in the working tree, for the session to review and commit. History
  keeps the old name by the retired-words rules (a `## Story`, a record, a
  quotation, a line about the rename), and a new name that is private is
  never written into a repository that may be public: that reference is
  listed for rewording in general terms instead.

  **The other three questions are the read, and they are meant to produce
  deletions.** A rule nobody has needed for a month, a paragraph that
  restates a practice the loader now carries, a sentence whose precision
  costs three readings — each is a candidate for removal or for moving,
  and [reduction-pass](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/reduction-pass.md) is how it moves. A pass that
  finds nothing to cut in a file this size has not read it.

- **One file nobody has read whole, read whole.** The bullet above is this
  one applied to a single file, and it was added the day somebody noticed
  that file had gone stale twice in itself. **Nothing generalized it**, and
  the measurement says the instructions file was not even the worst
  offender: [tools/verify_harness.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/verify_harness.py)
  is 26,000 lines, was touched 379 times in 30 days, gates every push in
  the project, and had no record of anyone ever reading it end to end.

  **Every other question in this check asks whether a file is wrong. This
  one asks whether anybody has looked at it as a thing lately**, which no
  amount of correctness per commit can answer — a file grows one
  defensible line at a time and nobody is ever wrong on the day they add
  theirs.
  [tools/very_deep_check.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/very_deep_check.py)'s
  `ACCRETION` section ranks every tracked file by **commits since anybody
  last recorded reading it whole**, and
  [record/holistic-reads.json](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/record/holistic-reads.json)
  is where that is recorded — a registry rather than a sentence in a
  document ([registry-source-of-truth](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/registry-source-of-truth.md)), for
  the reason the run ledger is one: *when did anybody last read this whole
  file* is exactly the claim memory gets wrong.

  **One file per run, not the top ten.** The count never reaches zero and
  the registry is what makes that visible; a slice of one, recorded with
  `--record-read`, beats a sweep of ten nobody finishes. The read itself is
  the instructions-file read asked of code as well as prose — *does this
  still describe something that exists; is it still needed; is it saying it
  the long way; is it duplicating something that now lives elsewhere* — and
  **a pass that finds nothing to cut in a file that size has not read it.**
  **Churn is not a defect**: the top row may be the healthy one, and the
  ranking buys only that a file nobody has opened whole cannot stay
  invisible because every commit to it was fine. Added 2026-09-21 (Morgan,
  strength: decided) from
  [spec/VERY_DEEP_CHECK_DEEPENING_PROPOSAL.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/spec/VERY_DEEP_CHECK_DEEPENING_PROPOSAL.md)
  item 9.
- **Contradictions** — two rules, or two documents, that can't both be
  followed; a rule whose own carve-outs have eaten it.
- **Documents against the mechanisms they describe.** A document that
  says what a tool, hook, workflow or check DOES is a set of claims about
  behaviour, and behaviour moves under it. For each such document — the
  install and setup routes, the specs that describe a tool (the loader,
  moving practices, the candidate pipeline, enforcement), the
  developer-facing documentation, the README's pitch, and the messages the
  tools themselves print, which are documents a person reads at the moment
  they most need them to be true — take each claim of behaviour and test it
  against the mechanism as it is now: run the command, or read the code
  path that would have to produce the claimed result. Not a read for
  broken links or stale names; those are the bullets below. A sentence
  that was true when written and is false now is a finding, and the fix
  is the sentence unless the behaviour is the thing that drifted. *(Added
  2026-09-14, the day a run found three in one afternoon without a bullet
  asking for them: a tool's post-landing line said the private sets carried
  no generated views, months after bootstrap started generating them; a
  spec said "the check can resolve it against the real sources" for a
  check nothing outside this repo's harness ran; and the guided install's
  every sentence was correct while the system it produced was not the one
  the pitch described. Each was found by rehearsal, which is pass 1's job
  and expensive; this is the cheap read that should have found them
  first.)*
- **What's new since the last run, and whether a reader would ever learn it
  exists.** The bullet above tests a claim that already exists against the
  mechanism it describes; it has nothing to say about a mechanism that never
  became a claim anywhere a person reads. Walk what landed since the last
  recorded run — `git log` from that run's date, across this checkout and
  every attached source, read against
  [record/very-deep-check-ledger.json](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/record/very-deep-check-ledger.json)'s
  own dates — and for each new practice, tool, command, or capability, check
  the surfaces a person actually reads for it: the README's pitch,
  [SETUP.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/SETUP.md),
  [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/INSTALL.md),
  [documentation/](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/documentation/), and
  [GLOSSARY.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/GLOSSARY.md). A
  person-facing addition with no mention anywhere on that list is a finding.
  An addition that is not person-facing — an internal refactor, a check only
  a session ever touches — clears this bullet by saying so, not by the
  question going unasked.
- **Rules we ship somewhere else** — the contradiction this pass kept
  missing, and it is missed for a structural reason rather than
  carelessness. **A template is inert here and binding there.** Read as a
  document, `templates/VOICE.md.template` makes no claims; instantiated
  into an adopter's repo it is a file of standing orders sitting beside the
  resident practice block, and nothing on either side compares the two. So
  ask it directly, every run: **what rules does this repository ship into
  somebody else's, and do they agree with the catalogue?**
  [tools/very_deep_check.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/very_deep_check.py)'s "RULES WE SHIP
  SOMEWHERE ELSE" section hands you the inventory — every shipped file
  carrying imperative prose, with a count — so this is a read of a short
  list, not a browse of a directory. **Read them against the RESIDENT
  practices first:** an on-demand practice reaches a session that thought to
  ask, so a shipped file contradicting one is a conflict nobody may ever
  hold both halves of; a resident one is in front of every session always,
  so a shipped file contradicting it puts two live orders in the same
  context window, every turn, in every adopter repo. The test for each
  shipped rule is one question — **would this improve anyone's work?** If
  yes it is a practice in the wrong place: land it in the catalogue and cut
  it from the template. If it is only true of that one project, it belongs
  in the file and should say why. *(2026-09-08: `VOICE.md.template` shipped
  205 lines of general writing guidance to every project, one of which said
  "no bold inside paragraphs, and no bolded thesis sentence" while the
  resident `bold-key-phrases` said to bold key phrases by default. Both had
  been true for weeks. The bullet above this one already said to look for
  contradictions and had never found it — a coherence read reads documents,
  and a skeleton file does not read as a document making claims.)*
- **Broken and misdirected references** — the mechanical half is the
  **MARKDOWN — STRICT SWEEP** section, which runs
  [tools/doc_lint.py](../tools/doc_lint.py) `--strict --all` over every
  tracked document and hands you per-class and per-file counts. **Strict is
  the point, and this is its only caller.** The light check reads what a
  change touched and the deep check gates on that; neither ever opens a file
  nobody has edited in months, and doc_lint's warning classes — unlinked
  references, unglossed acronyms, `target=` anchors — are gated nowhere at
  all, deliberately (a gate promoting them was built and withdrawn inside an
  hour on 2026-09-21, having refused a one-line edit over 111 warnings that
  predated it). So those classes accumulate exactly where only a sweep
  somebody asked for will ever look. **Work the list, do not obey it**: it
  is a work list, not a gate, nothing is expected to clear it in one run,
  and an index document carrying bare-backtick references may be right to —
  judge each file, fix a slice, commit it, run it again. Then read for what
  no linter can see: a link that resolves but points at the wrong thing, a
  click-path into a user interface that has changed, a cross-repo reference
  into a repo the reader cannot open, a slug or filename that moved.
- **Premise-dated claims — "the work now lives in X", where X is not
  there.** The bullet above tests a claim against the mechanism it
  describes; this one tests a claim about a **different file**, which is
  only ever caught by somebody who happens to open that file.
  [tools/very_deep_check.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/very_deep_check.py)'s
  `MOVED CLAIMS` section greps every repo in force for the sentence shape —
  *now runs in*, *now lives in*, *folded into*, *moved into*, *superseded
  by*, *replaced by* — and reports every named destination that does not
  exist.

  *(The incident, 2026-09-21: `commit-identity.yml` was paused with a
  header saying its checks "now run as steps in
  `.github/workflows/precedent-check.yml`'s single job". Four hours later a
  refresh deleted that file. The sentence was true when written and false
  the same afternoon, two commit-scope checks ran nowhere, and a grep at
  any point in the following month would have found it.)*

  **Three narrowings, each forced by a measurement rather than designed
  in.** `see X` is not a move verb and is deliberately excluded — it
  produced 39 rows across two repos, every one a pointer rather than a
  claim. A markdown link carries its own target, which `doc_lint` already
  checks, so link text is stripped before matching. And a **vendored** file's
  prose is upstream's, citing upstream's paths, so files the manifest
  records as vendored are skipped — pass 2's *this repo wrote it versus this
  repo received it* applied here. With all three, the first run returned
  **zero rows in three repos and five in the one where the incident
  actually happened**, all naming the deleted file. Added 2026-09-21
  (Morgan, strength: decided) from
  [spec/VERY_DEEP_CHECK_DEEPENING_PROPOSAL.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/spec/VERY_DEEP_CHECK_DEEPENING_PROPOSAL.md)
  item 14.
- **Stale references** — a slug, practice number, filename, heading, or
  click-path pointing at something moved or gone; a positional number cited
  as if it were a name; numbering that skips, repeats, or runs out of order;
  an orphaned name a rename elsewhere left behind in this repo's own prose.
- **Keywords with no entry** — every word or phrase that makes a session
  *act* ("very deep check", "full practice audit", "light check", "deep
  check") needs somewhere a session meeting it cold can look it up. A
  trigger word reachable only by already knowing it is not a keyword, it is
  folklore. The usual home is a practice's `defines:` field, which lands it
  in [GLOSSARY.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/GLOSSARY.md) — **but a glossary entry is not the
  property; being findable is.** Every standing command is listed by
  `python3 tools/precedent_vocabulary.py` and in AGENTS.md's command list,
  and `check_park_it.py` fails if the "Drop it" paragraph goes missing — so
  check where a keyword IS defined before calling it undefined. (An early
  "don't put it in the glossary", Morgan 2026-09-08, was later read
  narrowly; park-it's Story records why, and "Drop it" and "Go update" are
  in the glossary now.)
- **What every session loads, and what it costs.** The rule is
  [session-load-budget](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/session-load-budget.md) — every always-loaded surface
  carries a declared ceiling in
  [tools/session_load_budgets.json](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/session_load_budgets.json), and
  `precedent_check.py --only session-load-budget` tests this checkout's
  against them on every run. **What this pass adds is the half no ceiling
  covers**: the sum across every repo in force, and the judgment about what to
  move. Nothing is wrong at any single commit — every line in an always-loaded
  file was right to add on the day it was added, and it only goes wrong in
  aggregate, months later.
  [tools/very_deep_check.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/very_deep_check.py)'s "SESSION LOAD"
  section counts the instructions file section by section for this checkout
  **and for each attached shared and individual source**, plus the untracked
  practice file when private sources resolved, and flags any section large
  enough to be worth splitting and any entry whose own text says its trap is
  settled. **Read those flags, do not obey them:** an entry's claim that it
  was fixed is not evidence, and the verification is against the tree.
  **It also reports any FILE over the ceiling its own repo declared** — read
  from that repo's own registry, for every repo measured and not this
  checkout alone. That finding is not one of the flags above and is not read
  the same way: a large section is a question somebody may reasonably answer
  "it earns it", and a surface over its ceiling is a number somebody already
  decided being broken. What it asks for is
  [reduction-pass](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/reduction-pass.md)'s menu, and **never a raise**.
  **It reports a surface over its `target` too** (the lower number in the
  same registry, where the file is meant to live). Over target, this pass
  runs a reduction pass, **including its practice-by-practice review of the
  occasion index and resident block**, and reports what it proposes; a
  change that takes a rule out of a session waits for the person. *(Morgan,
  2026-10-01, after the first such review: "if it's not part of Very Deep
  Check, it absolutely should be", strength: decided.)*
  *(Added 2026-09-22, and the gap it closes is the reason to trust neither
  signal for the other's job. `precedent-individual` had AGENTS.md at 2,276
  tokens against a declared 1,800 — 476 tokens, 26% over — and every check
  green. Its largest section was 990 against a 2,500 threshold, so this pass
  was not
  merely quiet, it was correct: there was nothing section-sized to report.
  The overage was spread across five sections, and the one mechanism that
  does compare a file to its ceiling skips in any repo without the practice
  FILE — which that one is. It surfaced because somebody ran
  [tools/session_load_trend.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/session_load_trend.py) by hand,
  which is not a mechanism.)*
  Its "GOTCHA CURRENCY" sub-pass reads the other direction — **the tree
  against each entry, rather than the entry against itself** — because the
  settled-marker flag can only find an entry honest enough to say it is
  fixed, and the expensive case is the entry that still reads as live while
  the remedy it names has been renamed or deleted underneath it. It reports a
  named file, check slug or fixture that is no longer in the tree, an entry
  whose newest date has gone a season without re-measurement, and the token
  cost of each, so a reduction pass can be ordered by what it would actually
  save. Every one of those is a question, not a verdict: an entry may name a
  file that is gone precisely because it tells the story of a decommission.
  **What no longer bites moves to a linked archive in full, with the verdict
  that moved it — never to a deletion.**
  **The trap is optimising for the total, and it is the likely mistake rather
  than a remote one.** These sections exist because sessions kept losing hours
  to the same environment traps; a trimming pass that chases the number
  deletes the entries that are working. **The question for each part is
  "would a session hit this today", never "how big is it".** What no longer
  bites moves to a linked archive **in full** — the payload of a gotcha is the
  story of what failed ([environment-gotchas](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/environment-gotchas.md)), so a
  deletion eventually leaves a live section of unexplained rules.
  *(Found 2026-09-08, and the shape is why this belongs here: the resident
  block's 2,000-token budget had been reporting green for weeks while the
  file around it reached ≈17,000 — the budget governed 4% of the cost, and
  nothing was measuring the rest. The first pass moved 24 entries' full text
  to [record/GOTCHAS_ARCHIVE.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/record/GOTCHAS_ARCHIVE.md) and took ≈4,900
  tokens off every session, deleting nothing. A consuming repo measured the
  same day had the same disease in a different section, so this is structural
  rather than one repository's untidiness.)*
- **Whether each practice's TIER is still right.** The question above asks
  what the loaded text costs; this one asks which practices should be in it
  at all, and nothing else in Precedent ever asks it. `tier: resident` is
  governed only by [tools/build_views.py](../tools/build_views.py)'s hard
  2,000-token cap, which fails the build outright — so the trade is forced
  once, at the moment somebody adds a resident practice, and the set is never
  revisited afterwards. Read it in both directions. **Demote** a resident
  practice whose occasions turn out to be narrow enough that the path or
  occasion channel would reach them. **Promote** an on-demand practice that
  keeps being missed, which is the failure the tiering exists to prevent: an
  on-demand practice only reaches a session that thought to ask for it.
  **Judge the occasions, not the token count** — a demotion made to free
  budget is the SESSION LOAD trap one level up.
  *(Read [spec/LOADER.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/spec/LOADER.md)'s replay before any verdict, because
  it makes the third answer visible. It ran `verify-postcondition` and
  `environment-gotchas` resident at two Rule lengths; the arm reading only the
  resident block found `verify-postcondition` **0 of 2** with the long Rule and
  **0 of 3** with the short one, and `environment-gotchas` 0 of 2 and 0 of 2 —
  while in that same last run the arm reading the whole catalogue found them 3
  of 3 and 2 of 2. **Residency was doing nothing for either practice at either
  length**, and what both runs agree they needed was a `checked_by`. So
  "neither tier is the problem" is an available verdict, and was the right one
  twice.)*
  [tools/very_deep_check.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/very_deep_check.py)'s "TIER PLACEMENT"
  section hands you the resident set with each practice's occasion and
  whether a check already covers it, so this is a read of a short list. It
  enumerates and does not judge, and no `checked_by` will: the cap already
  tests the only property a script can see, and whether an occasion is
  *every session, always* is a reading of how work here actually goes.
- **Whether each practice's SOURCE is still right.** A different axis from
  the bullet above — not resident-versus-on-demand within one catalogue, but
  *which* catalogue a practice's slug lives in at all, across every source in
  scope: universal, each shared set, and the individual set. Read every
  practice's occasion and title against the charter each source states for
  itself (a shared set's own subject line — "how a session works alongside the
  person," "the craft of writing for a human reader," the maintaining team's
  own repo mechanics — and universal's implicit one, *everyone, always*), and
  ask: does this rule's actual subject match the source it is filed under, or
  did it land there because that is where the person happened to be
  when they approved it? **Three shapes to look for, each found on a first
  pass**: a rule that is personal wording wrapped around a general mechanism
  (an individual practice written in the first person for something any team
  would want — `"another window of mine"` for a collision any multi-session
  user hits); two sources independently authoring the same rule because
  neither one resolves the other (a shared set that declares no sources of its
  own re-deriving something universal already says, invisible to
  `no-duplication` because the two copies never sit in the same file to
  compare); and a rule that is topically a subject-team's own material,
  landed in universal or in a different shared set anyway, discoverable only
  by reading its prose against the destination's stated charter rather than
  its slug. **No script does this yet** — a source's charter is a sentence
  of prose, not a property `applies_to` or `scope` can encode, so this stays
  a judgment read, the same honest limit TIER PLACEMENT states for itself.
  *(2026-09-23: a session asked to do exactly this read, once, by hand,
  across precedent-individual and the three shared sets against universal,
  found instances of all three shapes on the first pass — five practices
  filed in precedent-individual that were general mechanisms in personal
  wording, two universal practices squarely inside working-style's own
  stated subject, and `vendor-neutral-by-default` independently authored in
  both universal's `local/practices/` and repo-maintenance, because
  repo-maintenance resolves no sources of its own and never saw the
  universal copy to compare against. The same session's reading also found
  `small-calls` and `push-back` sitting active in both a shared set and
  universal for three days after a 2026-09-19 move landed only its first
  half — a duplication this bullet would have caught on the next run rather
  than waiting for someone to notice by hand.)* Added 2026-09-23 (Morgan,
  strength: decided), after asking for a placement review across the five
  Precedent repos and finding this axis was never checked anywhere: the
  session's own report is the worked example above.
- **Orphans — files nothing owns any more.** The mirror of every other
  check here, which all ask whether something that should be present *is*.
  An orphan is present and in nobody's list, so no mechanism keyed on a
  current list can see it.
  [tools/very_deep_check.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/very_deep_check.py) now sweeps four
  kinds mechanically — a tombstoned engine file, a manifest entry the
  current kind dropped, an unrecorded engine file hand-copied in, and a
  `check_<slug>.py` whose practice is gone — so read only what it cannot:
  a document nothing links to, a workflow whose job moved, a directory a
  migration emptied. *(Found 2026-09-08: three practice sets each carrying a
  `precedent_retire_path.py` that a rename had orphaned, with `status`
  reporting all three healthy — it was gone from the file list, gone from
  the manifest, and the untracked-file check is keyed on the current lists
  by design. Three mechanisms, each correct, all blind to it at once.)*
- **Whether the SKELETONS still describe a real source.**
  `precedent_bootstrap_source.verify()` reads a skeleton and asks whether a
  real source has everything in it — which catches a source that drifted
  below the template and can never catch the template drifting below
  reality. Run the reverse: what does every resolved source of a level
  carry that a newly bootstrapped one would be created without? *(Found
  2026-09-08: the individual skeleton shipped no `identity.json` — the one
  place a person's name, address and timezone live, and the file that
  decides whether the commit hook ENFORCES an author-date offset or merely
  guesses one. Every real set had it; a bootstrapped set would not have,
  and its wrong-offset commits would reach the remote before anything said
  so.)* **One source of a level is not evidence** — the check says so
  rather than reporting one repo's working documents as a template gap.
- **Filenames, where the mechanical check is blind.**
  [filename-separator](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/filename-separator.md) is enforced per (directory,
  extension), so it catches a folder holding both `A_B.md` and `A-B.md`.
  It cannot see a directory that is internally consistent and wrong for its
  kind — a `practices/` full of `SCREAMING_SNAKE.md` is uniform and still
  breaks the slug convention — nor two directories that disagree where a
  person moves files between them, nor an exemption whose stated reason has
  stopped being true. Read those.
- **File location — does every file, documentation included, live where its
  kind already lives?** The mechanical checks assume placement is already
  right and test only naming and content; nothing here reads a file against
  the directory it sits in. Walk the top level and every directory with a
  declared purpose (`documentation/`, `spec/`, `practices/`, `tools/`,
  `todo/`, `gotchas/`, `record/`) and ask, for each file outside them,
  whether its kind already has a home: a reader-facing setup or how-to page
  at repo root while `documentation/` holds every other one, a design
  document outside `spec/`, a script outside `tools/`. Moving one is
  [rename-updates-links](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/rename-updates-links.md): search the whole tracked
  tree for the old path and repoint every reference in the same commit, not
  only the ones a grep for the bare filename happens to catch. *(Found
  2026-09-17: `PER_MACHINE_SETUP.md` and `CLOUD_SETUP.md` — both person-facing
  setup guides — sitting at repo root while `documentation/` already held
  `FOR_DEVELOPERS.md`, `FOR_EVERYONE_ELSE.md`, `GITHUB_SETTINGS.md` and every
  other reader-facing page; moved into `documentation/`, with roughly two
  dozen files across `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `SETUP.md`, `INSTALL.md`,
  `WHERE_THINGS_ARE.md`, `todo/`, `spec/`, `gotchas/`, `record/` and
  `documentation/` itself carrying a link to one or both, repointed the same
  commit.)*
- **Fragments** — a sentence, note, or heading left behind by an earlier
  edit: a "temporary" caveat whose occasion has passed, a note about a
  reorganization that already happened.
- **Needless repetition** — the same rule stated in full in several places,
  where one statement plus pointers would do.
- **Disproportion** — paragraphs of detail on a minor point, prose that
  emphasizes an aside more than the point it supports, a rule grouped where
  it no longer fits.
- **Rules that no longer make sense** — mechanical or written: a rule nobody
  can state the purpose of, a check that fires on correct work, a convention
  a later mechanism has overtaken. Deleting one is a finding as legitimate as
  fixing one.
- **Cost that isn't earned** — a rule or script that costs a disproportionate
  amount of tokens, time, or friction each time it applies, especially one
  re-researched from scratch on every occurrence instead of following a
  written-down answer; a step in a routine gate that has never produced a
  finding; a tool whose output nobody reads. Name what to delete, not only
  what is expensive.
- **Formatting and spacing drift** — inconsistent heading levels and
  capitalization, a bullet missing the blank line its neighbors have, mixed
  list markers, a ragged table, stray blank lines or trailing whitespace, a
  stale "last updated" header.
- **Self-application** — a rule this repo asks of every project it's
  installed into that this repo doesn't yet follow itself.
- **Cross-source staleness** — a check, tool, or convention this repo changed
  that an attached shared or individual source's own tooling, vendored engine
  copy, or written practice still assumes the old form of. Update the source
  in the same pass (per [cross-source-rollout](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/cross-source-rollout.md)) if
  it's attached; if a `blocked-on` TODO for it already exists, confirm it's
  still accurate rather than adding a second one.
- **Conflicting practices inside one source, and same-slug practices across
  two** — two rules in the same catalogue that cannot both be followed, and
  the same slug defined by two sources at the same level. Requested by
  Morgan 2026-09-07 and **not yet built as a mechanical step**: the
  cross-source half is already a hard `ResolveError`
  (`precedent_resolve.py` refuses a source list where two same-level
  sources define one slug), so what this pass adds is the *within-source*
  half, which nothing detects at all — two practices in one catalogue whose
  Rules pull opposite ways. The occasion for adding it was real: on
  2026-09-07 two sessions landed `fail-gracefully` and `bold-key-phrases`
  into both shared sets on the same day, each doing the obviously right
  thing, and the collision surfaced only because this check happened to
  resolve all four sources by hand.
- **Anything else the read turns up** — if something is wrong and none of the
  categories above name it, it is still a finding.

### Pass 4 — Catalogue, backlog, and branches
Last because none of it strands an adopter, and none of it is cheap.

- **The full catalogue, every practice.** Run
  [tools/full_practice_audit.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/full_practice_audit.py) across every
  source in force. That tool deliberately prints enforced practices as one
  line each; pass 2's *read each enforced practice's check against its own
  Rule* is where those get their real read, so the two
  together are what "every single practice was looked at" actually means.
- **Every universal, on-demand practice's `scope`.** The same read as the
  bullet above, one axis over: for each one, ask whether it could ever fire
  in an adopter repo, or only inside this repository's own mechanism (the
  loader, the routing table, the harness adapter tree, the philosophy tree).
  A wrong answer in either direction is a real cost — `any-adopter` on
  something that can only ever fire here is the token tax every adopter was
  paying before this field existed; `engine-dev` on something an adopter
  genuinely needs silently starves every adopter of a real practice, which
  is the worse of the two and the reason this is a judgment pass, not a
  regex. Fix drift in place, the same as any other catalogue finding here,
  and check that a newly `engine-dev`-scoped practice carries no relative
  link from a still-traveling sibling — [practice-links-travel](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/practice-links-travel.md)'s
  own check catches this mechanically, but only once the mismatch already
  exists; this pass is what catches a practice that *should* be re-scoped
  before that.
- **Private names in a public tree, and the leak recommendations.**
  [tools/very_deep_check.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/very_deep_check.py)'s
  `REPOSITORY VISIBILITY` section asks two questions that neither the push
  gate nor any offline check can answer together. Its `FINDING:` lines are
  the networked half — a repository this public tree NAMES which GitHub says
  is private, and the opposite, a blocklist entry for a repository that has
  since gone public and is now costing real content. Its `RECOMMENDATION:`
  lines are the offline half: a private-by-default repository sitting on this
  disk whose bare name no blocklist pattern matches — latent risk, nothing
  the tree says today.

  **This is the ONE place those recommendations are raised.** The push gate
  printed them on every run, so sessions relayed them on every run, and a
  recommendation arriving beside unrelated work is an interruption with a
  decision attached. They were moved here rather than switched off, which is
  the only version of this that does not trade noise for a blind spot: the
  gate still prints them under `--survey`, and this pass is what asks. Each
  one needs an answer — a stem, an `allow` line saying the name may be said,
  or a decision to leave it — and the answer is the person's, not the
  session's.
- **Every open item and every gotcha gets a verdict, and each one is acted
  on.** Read every open item in `todo/` and every live entry in `gotchas/`,
  in this repo and in each source in force, end to end. Each gets one of
  three verdicts, with its evidence in the same line:
  - **Still live** -- the item still waits on what it says, or the gotcha
    still bites (reproduce it, per question 12 above). Leave it.
  - **Outdated** -- the item is done, overtaken or no longer relevant; the
    gotcha's trap has been fixed or can no longer fire. **Close it in the same
    pass**: an item on its condition, with the commit or pull request that
    met it ([item-closes-on-its-condition](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/item-closes-on-its-condition.md)); a
    gotcha as `status: retired` in its own file, with the verdict and what
    fixed it ([environment-gotchas](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/environment-gotchas.md)). Name each one in
    the run record.
  - **Ambiguous** -- the evidence does not settle it. **Both** write it into
    the run record in [spec/VERY_DEEP_CHECK.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/spec/VERY_DEEP_CHECK.md), under
    its own heading for open items or gotchas, **and** ask the person in the
    reply: one line each, the item linked, what is unclear, and what the
    session would do and why. The record keeps the question for a later
    session; the reply is where the person actually answers it.

  **A `parked` item is never asked about** ([park-it](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/park-it.md)): it is
  reviewed only for being plainly done, closed if so, and noted in the run
  record alone. Treat an item that is really just an unfixed bug as work,
  not as backlog -- [todo-is-a-handoff](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/todo-is-a-handoff.md) queues only what
  is blocked or out of scope, so anything else there is either doable now or
  should be closed. Morgan, 2026-09-28 (strength: decided): *"review all to
  do's and see if any are outdated ... close them ... and then also to do the
  same with all the gotchas ... for both of these, the to-dos and the gotchas,
  should be both in the doc and ask the session user."*
- **Automated actions and schedules — crons, scheduled workflows, session
  triggers — across every repo and account in force.** Nothing else here
  sweeps these: a `schedule:` trigger in a `.github/workflows/*.yml`, an
  OS-level cron, and a session Routine or trigger this harness itself can
  create (its own trigger-listing tool enumerates them) all run in total
  silence between the moment they are set up and the moment somebody happens
  to look. None of it shows up in a diff the way a stale branch does — a
  schedule keeps firing, or keeps *not* firing, and either way the file that
  defines it goes on looking exactly as intentional as a live one. Enumerate
  every one: what it runs, on what schedule, when it last actually fired,
  and what changed when it did. Then give each a verdict — **needed**,
  **disable**, or **delete**. Disabling is a real, worth-keeping state for a
  workflow file (comment out the schedule, keep `workflow_dispatch` —
  [decommission-deletes-files](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/decommission-deletes-files.md) already names
  this as mid-decommissioning, not abandonment); it is not worth keeping for
  a session trigger, where re-creating one costs nothing and a stale one
  left enabled is a session that can wake unattended and act on
  instructions nobody has re-read. **Where the verdict is unclear, name it
  and ask the session's user rather than guessing** — a schedule paused on
  purpose, with a stated reason to resume it, reads identically in the file
  to one somebody forgot to finish decommissioning, and only a person who
  remembers the reason can tell the two apart. Write the full inventory —
  live and retired alike, with its verdict and the reason — to a committed
  `record/automated_actions.md`, for the same reason the branch sweep
  stopped living in the chat transcript: a list nobody can reopen gets
  rediscovered from scratch next run rather than read.
- **Deprecated files nothing has decommissioned.**
  [todo-2026-09-07-undeclared-deprecated-files](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/todo/todo-2026-09-07-undeclared-deprecated-files.md)
  named this gap and split it in two: a fully mechanical version was
  designed and rejected, because it cannot tell a deliberate pause from an
  abandoned one — the same ambiguity the bullet above now asks a person to
  resolve file by file. What it left for this pass is the cheaper half:
  read every mechanism in force — a tool, a workflow, a vendored tree, a
  config — against whether anything still calls it, and where it plainly
  does not, run
  [tools/precedent_decommission.py](../tools/precedent_decommission.py) on
  the path and act on a clean report exactly as
  [decommission-deletes-files](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/decommission-deletes-files.md) already
  requires for a deliberate decommissioning. **Where the audit is not
  clean, or the file's status is genuinely unclear, name it and ask the
  session's user** rather than deleting on a hunch or leaving it for the
  next run to rediscover unchanged. Record every path this pass looked at,
  and its verdict, in the same `record/automated_actions.md` the bullet
  above writes, so a path already cleared as deliberate is not re-examined
  from nothing next time.
- **Branches, both directions, one verdict each.** **Every branch on the
  repo's origin, from the oldest to the newest, ends this pass with a
  written recommendation: delete it, merge it, or cherry-pick a named part
  and delete the rest.** No branch is left out for being old, far behind,
  or somebody else's, and "unclear" is only allowed with what would settle
  it. The branch nobody remembers is the one this bullet exists for. *(2026-09-26: two week-old session branches in a
  consuming repo each held one commit that never reached `main`, two
  hundred commits back, and nobody could say what either was for. Morgan:
  *"I don't even know what that was, or if it's deprecated, or no longer
  needed, or if it was something useful ... it was completely
  forgotten."*)* Commits behind is not age: in a busy repo two hundred
  commits can be a week, so read the date, not the count.

  The *inventory* was already read at step 4 of the order of operations,
  for a different reason — to stop this run rediscovering work that
  exists. What is left here is the expensive half: a verdict on each.
  [tools/very_deep_check.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/very_deep_check.py) reports, for this
  checkout and for every source that is its own git checkout (a repo-local
  source inside the parent checkout shares its parent's branches and isn't
  swept separately), two lists per repo. Neither may be left without a
  verdict. **Every source the repo declares is swept, at any level** — what
  decides is whether the path is its own git checkout, which the tool
  settles by looking, not the source's level. A vendored tree inside the
  parent has no branches of its own; a sibling clone has plenty.

  **The list is also written to a file, not only printed.** A run's stdout
  is that session's chat transcript, which [repo-is-memory](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/repo-is-memory.md)
  already names as disposable — a person reading a run days later had
  nothing to open but a scrollback nobody kept. `_write_branch_report()`
  writes the same sweep, one clickable delete link (or, for an unmerged
  branch, a branches-page link and a compare-view link) per row, to
  `record/stale_branches.md` in the checked repo — regenerated on every run
  that does not pass `--skip-branch-scan`, and relocatable with
  `--branch-report PATH`. Commit the result so the links are live on the
  branch a person actually opens, the same way `MAP.md` and the ledger are
  committed rather than left as a run's private output (Morgan, reading a
  Sunday run that had produced the list twice and shown it neither time:
  *"it shouldn't live in the chat"*).

  **Committing the file is not the same as the run's own write-up carrying
  it**, and this repeated the exact failure once already, in a different
  shape: a session can point at `record/stale_branches.md` existing and
  still never put the checkout's safe-to-delete list in front of the
  person. `tools/very_deep_check.py --emit merged-stale-checkout` prints
  just the checkout's merged-and-stale list, and every real run of the
  checkout's branch scan writes that same markdown directly into a
  `<!--vdc-embed:merged-stale-checkout:...-->` block in
  [spec/VERY_DEEP_CHECK.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/spec/VERY_DEEP_CHECK.md)
  — so the list is IN the document a session writes up, not one file
  reference away from it, and **never truncated regardless of count**.
  **Deliberately NOT** the
  [computed-numbers-in-scripts](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/computed-numbers-in-scripts.md)/`doc_sync.py`
  gen-block mechanism most other script-computed tables in this repo use —
  that contract needs a script's output to be REPRODUCIBLE from the
  repository's own tracked files, and this one makes a live `git
  fetch`/`ls-remote` against the real GitHub origin, so its answer depends
  on the moment it runs, not on anything a commit fixes. Registering it in
  `doc_sync.py`'s `PAIRS` failed CI on the very first PR: the harness's own
  `enforced channel fires` self-test builds a scratch copy of the tree with
  no working remote to test a single planted violation, and the live scan
  inside that copy produced a different answer than whatever was committed
  — a drift with nothing to do with the violation under test. See the
  comment above `PAIRS` in
  [tools/doc_sync.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/doc_sync.py).

  *Merged and not deleted* — every branch fully merged into that repo's
  integration branch and still sitting there: a mechanical, offline fact
  (`git merge-base --is-ancestor`), true whether or not GitHub's own
  "merged" flag is set, which it is not for a repo that lands pull requests
  (PRs) by direct push rather than the merge button. Apply the
  branch-cleanup method [the-boildown](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/the-boildown.md) carries for every
  reply (it took the place of an individual set's own rule): skip the repo's default branch
  and its protected integration branch, and report each remaining one with
  a one-click delete link. **The link form, the encoding, the substring
  check and the separated unmerged list are
  [branch-delete-links](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/branch-delete-links.md)'s, in full and not restated
  here** — this pass is one of its two callers. A personal practice
  may decline to do this retroactive sweep on its own ("a separate, one-off
  task, done only when asked for directly") — a very deep check is exactly
  that direct ask, so this is the one place the sweep is a standing step.

  **This sweep stays inside the repos this check already reads — the
  checkout and the sources that are their own git checkouts — and is never
  widened to every Precedent repo the person owns.** That fleet sweep is
  [chief-of-staff](chief-of-staff.md)'s, placed there by Morgan on
  2026-09-21 with the reasoning worth keeping: branch hygiene is per-repo
  bookkeeping, not a finding in the seam between two repos, which is the
  class this check exists for. Widening it here would duplicate that
  practice and make an already expensive check more expensive for no new
  judgment.

  **Every branch, whoever wrote it**, and the author named on every row.
  The sweep used to be scoped to the invoking person's own GitHub login,
  on the sound reasoning that you do not delete somebody else's branch.
  That kept the deletion safe and made the list wrong: **the branches that
  accumulate longest are exactly the ones nobody in the room opened**, so
  the sweep reported a short clean list while the branch page grew every
  month (Morgan, 2026-09-12: *"find stale branches, even if worked on by
  someone else"*). Listing is not deleting — someone else's branch gets a
  verdict routed to them by name, never a silent skip and never a deletion
  on their behalf.

  *Merged into the base branch, not the integration branch* — the third
  list, and the one a single-target sweep turns into permanent noise. A
  repo pinned to an integration branch has **two** branches work can land
  on, and a branch merged into the base one and never into the integration
  one is finished work whose commits are simply not in this line of
  development. Tested against the integration branch alone it reports as
  *carrying unlanded commits*, with a verdict demanding somebody merge or
  close it, forever — and since nothing about it will ever change, those
  false rows accumulate until the list stops being read and the genuinely
  unlanded branch beside them goes unread too. Same ancestor test, other
  branch: equally safe to delete, and the row says which branch already
  carries it.

  **Every row carries the date it last moved, and the list is split at a
  declared staleness threshold** — `branch_stale_days` in the repo's own
  [precedent.json](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/precedent.json), overridable for one run with
  `--stale-days N`. Both halves are equally proven safe to delete by the
  ancestor test; the split sorts the chore rather than grading the
  branches. **Merged *and* long-finished is the safest thing on the page**;
  merged this week may still be checked out on somebody's machine, and
  deleting it under them is a small rudeness the ancestor test cannot see.
  A bare list of names cannot support either judgment, which is why one was
  never acted on — see the Story.

  **The threshold is a declared input, never a number in the engine**
  ([constants-are-risk-inputs](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/constants-are-risk-inputs.md)): the right
  value is a property of how fast a repo works, and a repo that has
  declared nothing gets the engine's conservative default.

  *Not merged* — the more expensive half, and the reason this bullet is not
  only about deletion. A merged branch nobody deleted is clutter; a branch
  that was meant to land and never did is lost work, and nothing in an
  ordinary week ever asks about it again. Each one is reported with what it
  is ahead by, when it last moved, and how many of its commits have no
  patch-equivalent on the integration branch — `git cherry`, not the
  ancestor test, because a branch that was rebased or squash-merged in
  reports as unmerged forever while carrying nothing, and calling that
  "unlanded" would train the reader to wave the whole list through. **Give
  every one a verdict: merge it, or close it with the reason recorded.**
  "Look at it later" is the state that produced the finding. Where the
  session cannot decide alone — the branch is someone else's, or its
  intent isn't legible from the diff — say so by name and ask, rather than
  leaving it unlisted.

  **Asking is not the same as listing.** A branch handed back to a person
  as a bare name and a commit count hands them the whole investigation
  too, which is how it gets postponed again. So every unmerged branch is
  written up with four things, in the reply and in the run record:

  1. **What the change is** — read the diff and say what the branch does,
     in a sentence or two. Not the commit subjects copied out: those say
     what each step did, not what landing it would mean.
  2. **A link.** Its most recent pull request (PR), when there is one.
     When there is **not** — a repo that lands work by direct push often
     has none at all — say so and link the branch's own compare view
     instead, rather than omitting the row or implying a PR exists.
  3. **The date it last moved**, so age is visible without asking.
  4. **A recommendation, with its reason** — merge, cherry-pick a named
     subset, or close. This is the part that makes the list decidable:
     check what the branch would actually do to the integration branch
     before recommending it, because a branch that is behind on shared or
     vendored files does not merely add its own work — merging it
     **reverts** theirs. Verified, not assumed: compare the vendored
     engine's recorded commit (or any generated artifact's manifest) on
     both sides. A branch carrying three genuinely-unlanded files on top
     of a forty-commit-old engine is a cherry-pick, never a merge, and
     saying "merge it" would have undone six weeks of work.

  Where a recommendation cannot be made honestly, say which of the four
  is missing and what would settle it.

- **Live sessions against the repo — what ran, and what it left behind.**
  The inventory was read at step 5 of the order of operations, to know what
  is running now. What is left here is the verdict half: **a session that
  ran inside the window and left no commit, no branch and no open PR.** Its
  conclusion exists only in a chat thread, which
  [repo-is-memory](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/repo-is-memory.md) says is already lost — so recover what
  it decided and commit it, or record that there was nothing to keep.
  Neither answer is automatic, and "it probably wrote nothing" is not one of
  them.

  Read it in both directions. A commit or a branch in the window that
  matches no session anybody can account for is the same question from the
  other side, and it is asked **before** that branch gets a verdict above.
  Uncommitted work in any clone in force is the same loss one step earlier:
  a fresh container takes it with it.

  **The tool can only do the repo half, and says so rather than implying
  coverage it does not have.** Which sessions ran, which are still running
  and what each was asked for lives in the harness and in no git history, so
  [tools/very_deep_check.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/very_deep_check.py)
  prints what landed — commits, branches, authors, dirty trees, per repo in
  force — and the session fetches the other half. The window is a declared
  input, never a number in the engine
  ([constants-are-risk-inputs](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/constants-are-risk-inputs.md)):
  `session_window_days` in the repo's own
  [precedent.json](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/precedent.json),
  `--session-days N` for one run, and a conservative default where a repo
  has declared nothing. *(Asked by Morgan, 2026-09-12: "do a sweep of live
  sessions against the repo to see if there's anything recent being
  missed." Nothing else in this check can see it — every other part reads
  the repository against itself, and this is the failure where the
  repository is internally perfect and the work never arrived in it.)*

- **What landed on the base branch and never came across.** The cheap half
  of the same relationship the rehearsal below tests, asked much earlier.
  **Where the repo has branch tiers it asks it of every pair**: what
  `staging` and `main` carry that `pre-staging` never took, and what `main`
  carries that `staging` never took — work lands on `pre-staging` now, so
  the old single question (the declared base against the default branch)
  was looking one tier too high. A row on a pair into `pre-staging` is not a
  choice to put to the person: everything above belongs below, and
  `python3 tools/precedent_branches.py --sync-pre-staging` (which a Promote
  runs first anyway) brings it down. A row nobody wants is a revert owed on
  the upper branch. Added 2026-09-28 (Morgan, strength: decided, "Go
  update").
  Runs only where the branch this repo works on is not its base branch —
  where they are the same branch there is nothing to drift from, and the
  section is recorded as skipped for that reason rather than as clean.
  [tools/very_deep_check.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/very_deep_check.py) lists every commit on
  the base branch with no patch-equivalent on the integration branch, each
  with its date, its subject and the files it touched.

  **`git cherry`, not the ancestor test**, for the reason the unmerged-branch
  half uses it: work reaches a long-lived integration branch by being
  *carried* — rewritten into that branch's own shape on the way — at least as
  often as by being merged, and commit identity reports "never arrived" about
  changes whose content landed weeks ago. A list padded with work that is
  already here trains the reader to wave the whole thing through, which is
  the failure this bullet exists to prevent rather than cause.

  **The output is a question for the person, and the run stops there.**
  Nothing is merged, cherry-picked or edited — not by the tool, and not by
  the session reading it. Go row by row: say what the change is and whether
  it belongs on this branch, and take only what they say to take. A row they
  decline is declined for that row, not for the list, and **the scan will
  show it again next run** — it compares two branches and knows nothing about
  any decision, so a deliberate not-carried lives in
  [spec/VERY_DEEP_CHECK.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/spec/VERY_DEEP_CHECK.md)'s
  run record, with its reason.

  **A repo that also keeps a carry watermark reads both.** This one did
  until 2026-09-27, when its upstream-carry notice was retired: main takes
  all its work from staging by Promote now, and the drift check in `tools/precedent_branches.py` answers by files what the
  watermark answered by commits. A watermark answers "has the base moved
  since somebody last carried from it"; this answers "what, specifically,
  has never come across", which is the thing a person can decide about. The
  first can read *current* while the second has rows, because a carry
  records the point it reached, not that everything behind it was taken.

- **The endgame merge, rehearsed against the whole tree.** A repo whose work
  is pinned to an integration branch is aimed at a merge it has not yet
  performed — this repo's fold-in of `staging` into `main` was the first
  case — and **with branch tiers it is every merge a Promote makes**:
  `pre-staging` into `staging`, then `staging` into `main`, each rehearsed
  in that order (since 2026-09-28; before then only the second was, and the
  first is the one that happens every day). Rehearse them here, every run:
  [tools/very_deep_check.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/very_deep_check.py) merges the
  integration branch into its base in a throwaway worktree, commits nothing,
  and reports **two sets, separately**. *Conflicting paths* are loud, and
  whoever runs the real merge will deal with them. *Paths present on the
  integration branch and absent from the merge result* are silent — no
  conflict, no message, no line in the merge output — and **that set must be
  empty.** Anything in it is a file that will disappear when the merge lands
  and that nobody will be told about.

  **What puts entries in it is history surgery on the base branch**, not
  anything wrong with the integration branch: a reverted merge, a
  cherry-pick, a force-push. Git decides what to replay from *history*, so a
  revert that undid the files while leaving the commits in the base's log
  makes git treat that work as already merged and then honour the deletion.
  Re-run the rehearsal whenever the base branch moves — a clean result last
  month says nothing about a base that has been touched since.

  **Two honest limits, both of which must be reported rather than assumed
  away.** On a shallow clone the merge base resolves wrongly or not at all,
  and an under-fetched history yields an empty difference that reads exactly
  like a clean one — so the rehearsal proves its history reaches the base or
  reports that it could not run. And an empty set means nothing *vanished*,
  not that the merge is *correct*: a file present in the result can still
  carry the wrong side's content, which only the conflict set read by a
  person will catch.

## Why
The mechanical audits ([doc_lint.py](../tools/doc_lint.py),
[leak_gate.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/leak_gate.py),
[precedent_check.py](../tools/precedent_check.py),
[doc_sync.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/doc_sync.py)) catch broken links, bad syntax, and enforcement drift; the
routing audit catches a practice that should have fired and didn't. None of
them reads a document's own argument for whether it still makes sense, and
none of them can ask whether a check is checking the right thing — a check
that is wrong reports cleanly, which is exactly why nothing downstream of it
will ever notice. Both are judgment calls by design, not gaps any of the
audits is meant to close, which is why this stays a separate, on-demand
mechanism rather than folded into one of them.

**The pass order is the finding order.** A whole-system review generates far
more small findings than large ones, and small findings are the ones easiest
to fix — so an unordered run reliably spends itself on typography while an
adopter's install stays broken. Passes 1 and 2 are the ones whose misses
reach someone outside this session; passes 3 and 4 are the ones whose misses
cost the next session some confusion. Fixing in that order is not a
preference, it is what makes the check worth its cost.

**Read this before trusting the result, the same caution
`full-practice-audit` states for itself.**
[spec/ATTENTION_CEILING.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/spec/ATTENTION_CEILING.md)'s review-arm result
(54% recall on a whole-catalogue judgment pass, worse than no review at all)
was measured against practice-compliance judging, not document-coherence
reading or fixture-building — different tasks, so that figure does not
transfer here directly — but nothing has evaluated this specific mechanism's
own reliability either. Treat it the same way: a backstop for what
enforcement cannot reach, not a substitute for enforcement, until it has its
own evaluation. Pass 1 is the partial exception, and the reason it is first:
building a fixture and running the checks on it produces evidence, not a
judgment, so its findings do not depend on this caveat.

**Kept on the explicit ask, as a session's own judgment call, when the
2026-09-16 conversation widened several other commands to plain intent.**
This is the same reasoning [full-practice-audit](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/full-practice-audit.md)
gives for itself: a whole-repo, multi-pass review is expensive to run
unprompted, so a message that only sounds like it might want one earns a
clarifying question, not a launch.

## Story
**The live-session sweep and the wider branch sweep were Morgan's,
2026-09-12, in one sentence each.** The first — *"do a sweep of live
sessions against the repo to see if there's anything recent being
missed"* — names a gap every other part of this check is structurally
blind to: they all read the repository against itself, and none of them can
see work that never arrived in it. The second — *"find stale branches, even
if worked on by someone else ... Alex likely has branches on main from
bestpractice from weeks ago, and the list of branches is getting longer and
longer"* — is a correction to a sweep that was working exactly as written
and reporting the wrong thing twice over: it filtered to the invoking
person's own branches, which are the ones most likely to be dealt with
anyway, and it tested merged-ness against the integration branch alone, so
every branch finished on `main` read as unlanded work forever. **Both
halves of that made the list shorter and less true.** The first run after
the change reclassified one branch here out of the unlanded list, and named
authors on rows that had carried none.

**The base-branch read was Morgan's, 2026-09-12**, and what makes it worth
recording is that this repo already had the drift and nobody had counted it.
The check has rehearsed the endgame merge since 2026-09-07 — it asks what
happens to *our* files when `precedent-beta-v01` finally lands on `main` —
and it has never once asked the opposite direction. The upstream-carry
notice at session start (retired 2026-09-27) read *"origin/main is unchanged
since the last carry"* the morning this landed, which is true and is a different question: **the watermark records
the point a carry reached, never that everything behind it was taken.** The
new section, run against this repository the same day, found two commits on
`main` with no patch-equivalent on the branch — a 2026-09-03 revert touching
634 files, and a 2026-09-08 practices-and-lint commit touching four. Neither
is a surprise to anyone who knows the history; **neither was on any list.**

He fixed the shape in the same sentence he asked for the check: *"those
changes, don't implement automatically, but ask the session user if they want
to implement them."* It is the same limit the upstream-carry notice was
built to on 2026-09-08 — *"I don't want it to merge invisibly, I'd like to
do it in a session when I'm there"* — and stating it twice, about two
different mechanisms, is what makes it a property of this repo rather than a
detail of one tool.

**The component ledger was Morgan's, 2026-09-11**, and it was asked for in
the shape of a suspicion rather than a complaint: *"maybe the simulation
doesn't find anything so it's not worth it to do."* The check had grown to
around twenty sections, each added by a run that wanted it, and **not one of
them had ever been asked to justify itself** — there was no record of what
any part had returned, so the question could not be settled by anything but
memory. **What is on the record is only the asking**: no section has yet
been retired on this evidence, and claiming one had would be the invention
[no-invented-specifics](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/no-invented-specifics.md) forbids. The first run
after it landed did make one thing plain — the printed checklist is by far
the largest thing the tool emits, and it finds nothing by construction,
because it is material for a session to read rather than a check. That is a
cost question, not a usefulness one, which is why the run prints the two
side by side and decides neither.

**The liveness half was Morgan's, 2026-09-11**, and it was asked for
before anything broke: *"make sure it doesn't automatically try to open a
repo that doesn't exist / was deleted / archived."* No deleted or archived
source has cost this project a session yet, and saying otherwise would be
the invention [no-invented-specifics](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/no-invented-specifics.md) forbids.
What IS on the record is both of its neighbours, twice over in
[AGENTS.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/AGENTS.md)'s
gotchas: a clone URL whose capitalization GitHub answered with *"this
repository moved"* — the rename case, diagnosed as the cause of an
unrelated failure it had nothing to do with — and a session that read
*"access to this repository is not enabled"* as a token problem and went
looking for a credential that was fine. Both are what a repository that has
quietly stopped being reachable looks like from this side, and in both the
expensive part was the misdiagnosis, not the outage.

Named in [PRACTICE_ENGINE_PLAN.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/spec/PRACTICE_ENGINE_PLAN.md)'s v28 amendment
(2026-09-01) as "the inherited RepoPersonalPreferences (RPP) audit list ...
heavier than any of [light check, deep check, routing audit] ... not yet
inventoried here (RPP is a separate private repo); enumerate and wire it as
an on-demand tool when phase 5 or later actually needs it" — tracked nowhere
else, the same
structural gap [spec/UNBUILT_PLAN_ITEMS.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/spec/UNBUILT_PLAN_ITEMS.md)
found `routing-audit` fell into, and logged there as `TODO.md` item 17.

Enumerating it turned up that earlier that same day, the phase-3 private-set
migration (v27) had carried a related list into the maintainers' own team set
(private, so named rather than linked) as its own `deep-check` practice. This
practice and its tool are the universal audit: available to any repo running
Precedent, not only Morgan and Alex's.

**Corrected 2026-09-06, on Morgan's ruling: the team's `deep-check` and this
practice are unrelated rules, and the deep check keeps happening in sessions
when committing, as it always did.** This Story previously described the team
practice as "generalized ... but otherwise the same enumeration as here," and
that sentence was wrong in a way that did real damage: it was read as
authority to drop `deep-check` from the team set as redundant, which removed a
routine per-commit check for a day.

The two differ in kind and cadence. `deep-check` is the working check a
session runs against its own repo as part of landing work. This practice is a
rare, expensive, cross-repo audit of the whole Precedent system —
"deliberately rare because the judging is expensive", and by its own Rule
never wired into a commit, push, or merge gate. Dropping the routine check on
the authority of the occasional one was the error, and this Story made it look
reasonable. The team's `deep-check` is restored to `active`, and the open
question this Story used to carry — whether it should point here via
`overrides:` — is answered: **it should not.** They are not the same rule, so
there is nothing to override.

This is the whole argument of
[decisions/2026-09-06-deduplication-not-retirement.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/decisions/2026-09-06-deduplication-not-retirement.md)
in miniature: two rules resembled each other, and resemblance was accepted as
coverage.

Revised 2026-09-05, on Morgan's direct request, adding the missing-source
failure and the stale-branch sweep. Both were real, reproduced, not
hypothetical: this repo's own team source (`../precedent-team-repo-maintenance`)
is declared in [precedent.json](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/precedent.json), yet nothing before that
revision made a session go get the sibling clone, so a session starting in a
fresh checkout would run the tool, see the source reported "missing" on
stderr, and call the result a very deep check anyway. And a request in the
same conversation to actually run the newly-added sweep surfaced real,
currently-undeleted stale branches across every repo in force in that
session — several merged by direct push, with GitHub's own `merged` flag
still `false` for that reason, confirming the sweep's note is not
hypothetical either. Revised again the same day to add the
cross-source-staleness bullet, whose standing prevention side is
[cross-source-rollout](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/cross-source-rollout.md).

Restructured 2026-09-06, on Morgan's direct request, into the four ordered
passes above. Two things drove it. The first was the pre-launch audit of the
same date ([spec/PRELAUNCH_AUDIT.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/spec/PRELAUNCH_AUDIT.md)): every one
of pass 2's questions but one is a defect that audit actually found, and not
one of them was reachable from the drift checklist this practice carried at
the time — the check was looking only at prose while the mechanisms
underneath it were reporting confidently and wrongly. The second was that
the audit found all of it by building fixtures and running checks on them,
which the practice never asked for; the "simulate a from-scratch install /
simulate the migration" items Morgan raised are that method written down as
a standing step. The run being explicitly splittable across sessions came
from the same request, for the obvious reason: what this practice now asks
for is more than one session's work, and a check nobody finishes is a check
that silently becomes its first pass.

Extended the same day, same request, with two things the restructure had
left implicit. Morgan asked whether the check looks for duplicate code —
two parts doing the same job redundantly — and it did not: the old
checklist's "needless repetition" is about a *rule* restated in prose, and
the two places code duplication appeared were incidental (a tie-break
between two copies of a file; a rule forbidding the copies the vendoring
tool makes). It is a mechanism property, not a writing one — a duplicate
does not stay identical, and the copy that goes on being wrong is as likely
as not the one that runs — so it belongs in pass 2, immediately before the
tie-break question it generalizes, rather than appended to pass 3's list.
The restructure had produced an instance of it in the same commit: this
practice's own checklist existed both here and as a `CHECKLIST` literal in
[tools/very_deep_check.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/very_deep_check.py), and the tool
printed the copy. The order of operations came from the same message: the
passes were ordered, but nothing said to run the cheap mechanical gates
before spending judgment, which is how a session ends up hand-reading for
something `doc_lint` reports in a second — and, worse, cannot tell drift
this run introduced from drift that was already there. Two positional
cross-references ("pass 2 item 10") were replaced with names in the same
pass, since citing a list position as if it were a name is a defect pass 3
tells the reader to report.

Extended 2026-09-07, on Morgan's proposal, after the run that prompted it
had already demonstrated the case: he suggested adding a step where a real
repository is attached and its vendored copy updated, because that is how
the session had just found its bugs.

It is the right idea, and the diagnosis underneath it is sharper than
"fixtures versus reality". Every pass-1 fixture builds a repo that has
never had to MOVE. An install happens once; an update happens forever, and
nothing here had ever tested one. That gap splits in two, and both halves
are now bullets: a scratch consumer vendored at an old commit and brought
forward tests drift cheaply and needs nobody's permission, while a real
consumer tests what only accumulation produces — an undeclared visibility,
a hand-mirrored engine, prose that grew up naming a private source, and a
vendored copy of the update tool old enough to be dangerous.

It is deliberately NOT a fifth pass. The passes are ordered by what a miss
costs, and a fifth one sits in the position most likely to be skipped —
which is exactly wrong for the highest-yield step there is. It belongs in
pass 1, where "an adopter is stranded" already lives. What does move to
the front is the ASKING: attaching a repository is the person's act, and a
question asked at the end of a long session is not a question, it is a
postponement.

The evidence: on 2026-09-07 the scratch fixtures passed, and one real
consumer then produced seven defects in a row — four of them in mechanisms
that same run had built or fixed hours earlier, one needing two attempts
because the second failed with an identical message. The pre-launch audit
had already named this gap in as many words and it stayed named and
unfilled until somebody attached a repository.

Split 2026-09-07, on Morgan's question — should the check look at unmerged
branches before anything else, so a session stops rewriting what was
already written and never merged? It should, and the reason is that the
sweep had been one thing when it is really two.

Pass 4 is last because "none of it strands an adopter", which is true of
deleting merged branches — that is clutter. It is not true of unlanded
work, and the run that prompted this proved it: two missing files were
rediscovered from scratch, written up as findings, and filed as open TODO
items, while the fixes sat finished on a branch from the previous day in
both private sets, named in those branches' own commit subjects. The cost
of a late sweep is not untidiness. It is duplicated work and a backlog that
records solved problems as open.

So the inventory — cheap, mechanical, and the only step here that PREVENTS
work rather than finding it — moves to step 4 of the order of operations,
before any pass. The verdicts — expensive, and judgment — stay in pass 4.
[tools/very_deep_check.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/very_deep_check.py) prints the
unlanded-work block before the checklist a session works from, and
verify_harness.py asserts that ordering specifically, since a block that
exists but prints last is exactly the failure being fixed.

Extended 2026-09-07, on Morgan's direct request, during the first run of
this practice: he asked for a summary, a link, a date and a recommendation
for each unmerged branch, so that he could actually decide about them. The
run that prompted it had reported four unmerged branches correctly and left
him with four names and four commit counts — which restates the finding
rather than resolving it, since the investigation each one needs was still
entirely undone.

The recommendation item earned its emphasis immediately. Two of those four
branches carried genuinely unlanded work — including, in both private sets,
the very files that same run had independently rediscovered as missing and
filed as open TODO items. The obvious recommendation was “merge them”. It
was wrong: both branches sat on a vendored engine 41 commits behind their
own `main`, so merging either would have reverted the engine wholesale in
order to land three files. Checking what a merge would *do* to the
integration branch, rather than only what the branch contains, is the
difference between a useful recommendation and a damaging one, and nothing
here had asked for it.

Made mechanical 2026-09-07, on Morgan's question of whether the check should
force a fetch before anything else. It should, and prose was never going to
carry it: the order of operations added the day before *said* to freshen
first, and prose is exactly what a session skips when the thing it is stale
about is the instructions. The evidence was already written down three
times in [AGENTS.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/AGENTS.md)'s gotchas — a session 366 commits behind
that reported files landed days earlier as not existing, and a
session-start guard that could not help because the container's copy of the
guard predated the guard. So the tool now fetches and compares every repo
in force as its first act and exits non-zero on anything it cannot prove
current. Two design calls worth keeping: it *verifies* rather than mutates
by default, since a tool that pulls inside a clone handed to it is its own
gotcha in that same section — one silently moved a session's checkout onto
another branch mid-session — and `--freshen` therefore declines a diverged
or dirty tree outright, where a fast-forward would discard someone's work.
And it separates "cannot reach origin" from "this branch was never pushed",
because the two have unrelated remedies and the wrong one sends the reader
to debug a network that is fine. Both source repos in the session that
built this failed the new gate on first run — one seven commits behind, one
on a local-only branch — neither of which anything before this would have
reported.

Extended again 2026-09-07, on Morgan's question about branches that were
meant to be merged and got lost in the mix. The sweep had the data and only
half the question: it listed unmerged branches as an aside to the deletion
report — "check each one's PR history for a superseded case" — which asks
only whether the branch is safe to *drop*, never whether it holds work that
should have landed. The two failures are not symmetrical, and the one the
sweep was blind to is the expensive one. The scan now reports commits
ahead, last-commit date, and a patch-level count via `git cherry`, which
matters more than it sounds: `merge-base --is-ancestor` reads commit
identity, so a rebased or squash-merged branch reads as unmerged forever
while carrying nothing, and a report calling those "unlanded work" would
teach the reader to wave the whole list through. On the first run it found
a source branch nineteen commits deep, untouched since the day before, that
nothing in this repo would otherwise have asked about again.

Extended again 2026-09-10, and both halves came from Morgan asking a plain
question about a real sweep: *does this give me a list of branches I can
delete, across all the repos?* Reading the answer showed two things the
sweep had been quietly getting wrong.

**The deletion list had no dates.** The unmerged half had carried its date
since the day above; the merged half — the half that actually ends in
somebody deleting something — was a bare list of names. That is the wrong
shape for the decision it feeds. Measured the same day on this repo: 69
merged, undeleted branches, median age three days, oldest 39, and no way to
see any of that from the report. The branch merged an hour ago and the one
merged last quarter rendered identically, so the reader either deletes
blind or defers the list again, and deferring is what had happened every
time. Each row now carries its last-commit date and age, and the list is
split at a declared threshold. **What made the threshold worth declaring
rather than fixing in code**: the engine's conservative default of 90 days
put *every one* of this repo's 69 branches on the recent side — a feature
that shipped inert in the repo that asked for it. This repo declares 30.
Nothing measured that either number is right; both are values picked to fit
a distribution, said so in [precedent.json](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/precedent.json) rather than
dressed up ([no-invented-specifics](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/no-invented-specifics.md)).

**And the sweep covered fewer repos than it read as covering.** It scanned
this checkout plus sources at the `team` and `individual` levels only,
because it reused `FATAL_MISSING_LEVELS` — the list of *whose absence
aborts the run* — as if it also meant *whose branches are worth sweeping*.
Two different questions, the same tuple, and they came apart the moment a
repo declared a universal or repo-local source that is its own clone: its
branches were never looked at, and the report named no gap, because the
level test had already decided there was nothing there. The lesson is the
narrow one: **a constant that answers one question is not evidence about
another, however well it fits.** The tool asks every declared source now
and lets the one honest test — is this path its own git checkout — answer,
which it settles by looking; sources resolving to one clone are swept once.

**The same day, one more, and it was found by running the check rather
than reading it.** The sweep widened above could not actually reach the
repos it had just been widened to: in a session where the credential route
was working exactly as [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/INSTALL.md) §8 describes — all four
private sources cloned before the first turn — **every one of them failed
this tool's own freshness gate** with *"could not read Username for
`https://github.com`"*, and the run refused to read a line. The token was
fine. The tool's `_run_git` shelled out to plain `git`, while the
credential lives behind a helper only
[tools/precedent_source_bootstrap.py](../tools/precedent_source_bootstrap.py)
was passing — so a source could be **cloned** at session start and then not
**fetched** by the check that reads it.

Two things are worth keeping from it. **The guard was right about the state
and wrong about the cause**, which is the expensive combination: a hard
refusal reads as the gate doing its job, and the message sent the reader to
re-set a token that was never the problem. The fetch failure now names
*which* failure it was, reusing the diagnosis the bootstrap tool already
had rather than growing a second copy. And **the fix went in `_run_git`
keyed on the git subcommand**, not at the three call sites that fetch
today: this sweep grew three new fetches in a fortnight, and a per-caller
fix covers whatever existed the day it was written
(durable-fix, now part of [upstream-fix](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/upstream-fix.md)).

**The generator check above came from a question, not a failure, and that is
worth saying plainly.** Morgan asked on 2026-09-11, after reading how a
brand-new adopter with no team or individual set gets one, whether that path
was tested here at all — and named the shape of what worried him: he updates
the files in his own sets over months while the generator that made them
keeps moving, and nothing would ever say the two had parted. It had not been
tested. Two checks looked adjacent and neither was: `verify()` asks whether a
real set still has every file the skeleton ships, and the template-freshness
scan asks the reverse for filenames — **both are about which files exist, and
between them they had never compared a single byte.** No incident is attached
because none happened; a gap can be found by reading, and
[cite-the-incident](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/cite-the-incident.md) asks for the real story, which here
is that somebody asked the right question before it cost anything.

**Its first real run, the same day, found drift in all four live sets and
also found the check too long to read.** Every set's vendored engine was an
older upstream vendoring, and `commit-identity.sh` differed from canonical
in every one — the drift [todo/TODO.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/todo/TODO.md)'s `source-hook-drift` item
already tracks, confirmed here by a mechanism that knew nothing about it.
**The defect was the output.** A set vendored at an older commit differs in
*every* engine file at once, so one fact printed as a dozen findings: 60
lines carrying about six facts, which is how a check teaches people to skim
it. One older vendoring is now one row, absent files the engine gained since
folded into it, while a hand-edited file still gets its own line naming the
file — the distinction that decides whether you refresh or move the change
upstream. And `.claude/settings.json` moved from shape to owned: a set may
legitimately wire its hooks from somewhere other than `.claude/hooks/`, which
`verify()` already allows and one live set deliberately does, so calling that
drift reported a decision as a defect on every run.

**The dedup ledger was Morgan's, 2026-09-20**, raised in a session rooted in
`precedent-individual` rather than here — that session had no push access to
this repository, so what it could actually do was write up the design in
full and hand it off, which is where `VERY_DEEP_CHECK_DEDUP_LEDGER_PROPOSAL.md`
comes from — that repo's own root, private, so named rather than linked here
(`check_practices_link_only_reachable_repos`, verify_harness.py). No verbatim
quotation mark here, deliberately: that document paraphrases the conversation
it came out of rather than quoting it, and this entry follows what it
actually says rather than inventing a quote the handoff itself does not
carry — [no-invented-specifics](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/no-invented-specifics.md).
`CONVERGENT DRIFT`, as built, has no memory across runs: a file two or more
sets have drifted onto the same way prints as a fresh `FINDING` forever,
including one a person already read and judged **never going to
generalize**. Investigating found the noise was never the comparison logic
— that was already right — it was the absence of anywhere to put a verdict
once a person had one. Asked whether the fix should live as a private detail
inside `_convergent_drift()`, the answer was broader: a convention any repo
can hold its own record in — the decision belongs to the repo the finding is
about, not to the tool reading it. The argument ran by analogy to the
beta-branch watermark, then kept in the individual source; that file moved
into this repository on 2026-09-22, so the principle outlived the example. The
session that wrote the proposal created `very-deep-check-decisions.json` at
that repo's own root, empty and schema-documented, ready for the read side
built here to consume without rework.

**The strict markdown sweep was Morgan's, 2026-09-21**: *"'Very deep check'
should include a markdown check that is --strict. We dont' do that upon a
PR because many give warnings, which is rejected in strict mode. But in a
full detailed sweep, you can find those cases and fix them."* That names
the gap exactly, and it is the second half of an ask he had already made
that morning, in the conversation that took the markdown check out of CI:
*"remove all markdown checks in the yml github actions check (but we
should use the strict markdown in our own that we do)."* The removal
landed; the parenthesis did not, until now.
[doc_lint.py](../tools/doc_lint.py)'s warning classes had been gated
nowhere since the strict gate was withdrawn that same day — the right call for a
commit gate, and it left the classes with no reader at all, because the
light check only ever sees what a change touched. A sweep is the one
context where a wall of pre-existing warnings is the thing being asked for
rather than an obstacle to the work in hand.

Building it surfaced two things worth recording. **`--strict` did not
exist, and nothing said so**: [doc_lint.py](../tools/doc_lint.py) ignored
unknown options silently, so [documentation/GITHUB_ACTIONS.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/documentation/GITHUB_ACTIONS.md)
had been telling adopters to run `doc_lint.py --strict <files>` as their
by-hand markdown check — an instruction added by the very commit that
withdrew the flag, so it was stale on arrival, and it had been passing all
the same: running the ordinary lint, exiting 0. Unknown options are
refused now. **And a tenth of the backlog was not a finding**: the
unlinked-reference detector matched any backticked span ending `.md` or
`.py`, so `python3 tools/doc_lint.py` counted as an unlinked file
reference — 177 of 2,323 findings in this tree were command lines, which
no link can fix. A strict mode whose first act is to demand an impossible
fix is a mode that gets run once, which is the withdrawn gate's failure
one layer down. The detector now asks whether the span is a path at all —
which took a second pass, because the same measurement, run again on what
was left, found 148 globs and placeholders (`practices/*.md`,
`gotchas/gotcha-<date>-<slug>.md`) in the same position. What remained —
2,001 references that day — is the real backlog, and it is a work list
rather than a gate for the reason above.

**Working the first slice proved why the list is judged rather than
executed.**
[SETUP.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/SETUP.md)
carried 21 of them and two were fixable: the rest
name `AGENTS.md`, `GETTING_STARTED.md`, `STYLEGUIDE.md` and
`local/practices/project-voice.md` **in the repository the reader is
installing into**, not in this one, where three of those four do not exist
at all. Linking them would have manufactured broken links in an
outward-facing document — the exact incident that put the
broken-relative-link check here (96 of them, from paths resolved against
the repo root instead of the linking file's own directory). A document
describing somebody else's tree is right to carry bare names, and a sweep
that treats the count as the target will break it.


### Approval history

**Every extension, revision and bounding this practice has had, from
2026-09-05 to 2026-09-22.** It used to live in the `approved_by:`
frontmatter field, where it had grown to 2,024 words across 183 lines.
[spec/PRACTICE_FORMAT.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/spec/PRACTICE_FORMAT.md)
describes that field as recording *who* approved a practice and *when*; a
changelog of what each approval changed is history, and history is this
section's job
([deliverables-look-like-output](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/deliverables-look-like-output.md): a
practice's own originating incident goes to its `## Story`). Moved
2026-09-23, with nothing shortened on the way out — the frontmatter field
now names the approver and points here.

**Every entry carries an explicit date, and new ones must too — never
*same day*.** Six entries originally dated themselves by pointing at the
entry above them, which is a *positional* reference: it survives only as long
as nothing is reordered, and it is unreadable on its own. Worse, two adjacent
entries both saying *same day* meant two different days, because the first
one's text ended with a clause carrying a later date than the change the
entry itself recorded. Those six were resolved to real dates on 2026-09-23,
each one marked *(written as "same day")* so the original wording stays
visible and nobody reads the date as something the approver typed.

**Five of the six resolve cleanly** — the entry above them names exactly one
date and nothing else. **One is a read, not a derivation:** *"Extended
2026-09-07 … so the branch sweep reports an unmerged branch with a
merge-or-close verdict"*. The entry above it is itself a *same day* entry
recording a 2026-09-06 change, but its text then runs on into a clause about
a step *"made mechanical 2026-09-07"* — so *same day* attaches to the nearest
antecedent, 09-07, not to the 09-06 change the entry opened with. The
following entry, dated 2026-09-07 outright, refines that same branch sweep,
which fits. It is the one date here that was inferred rather than read off
the text, and it is flagged in place as well as here.

**The list runs oldest first, and a new entry goes at the BOTTOM.** Sorted
2026-09-23, once every entry carried its own date. Before that it ran in two
directions at once: recent additions had been prepended at the top as they
were written, while the original chain from `pending review` onward ran
forward, so a reader met 2026-09-22 first, then seven 2026-09-21 entries,
then 2026-09-14, then jumped back to 2026-09-05 and read forward. Two entries
a day apart could sit thirty rows apart.

**Two things the sort had to assume, said out loud because neither is
recoverable from the text.** Within the prepended block, the entry nearest
the top was the one added last, so that block was reversed rather than kept
as it stood — the dates running non-increasing down it are the evidence.
And the two 2026-09-14 entries, one from each block, cannot be ordered
against each other at all: nothing in either says which came first, so the
one written into the field earlier is placed first. **If that pair is the
wrong way round, it is the only pair the sort could have got wrong.**

**One entry was never approved by anyone**, and says so in place: the
2026-09-12 does-it-ever-run addition to pass 2, marked PENDING REVIEW when
it landed and still unreviewed.

<!--dated-list-->
- **Originally: pending review** — the practice landed with no named approver.
- **Revised 2026-09-05, Morgan F**, to require every declared team/individual source actually be in the session before the check runs, and to add a stale-branch sweep across every repo the check touches
- **Revised again 2026-09-05 (written as "same day"), Morgan F**, to add a cross-source-staleness check
- **Restructured 2026-09-06, Morgan F**, into four ordered passes — adopter installs first, then whether the mechanisms tell the truth, then the coherence read, then catalogue and housekeeping — with the run made resumable across sessions
- **Extended 2026-09-06 (written as "same day"), Morgan F**, with a duplicate-implementation question in pass 2 and an explicit mechanical-before-human order of operations; that order's first step made mechanical 2026-09-07, Morgan F — every repo in force must be provably current before the check reads anything
- **Extended 2026-09-07 (written as "same day" — see the note above), Morgan F**, so the branch sweep reports an unmerged branch with a merge-or-close verdict, not only a merged one awaiting deletion
- **Extended 2026-09-07, Morgan F**, so each unmerged branch is written up with what it changes, a link, its date and a reasoned recommendation, rather than handed back as a name
- **Split 2026-09-07 (written as "same day"), Morgan F**, so the unmerged-branch INVENTORY is read before any pass and only the verdicts stay in pass 4
- **Extended 2026-09-07 (written as "same day"), Morgan F**, so pass 1 tests an UPDATE and not only an install, against a real consumer repository and not only a fixture
- **Extended 2026-09-07, Morgan F**, with pass 2's enumerate-rather-than-sample question and pass 4's whole-tree rehearsal of the endgame merge, after a sampled rehearsal of the phase-7 merge-back returned the wrong verdict
- **Extended 2026-09-09, Morgan F (strength: assented)**, with pass 3's tier-placement question, after a session asked what this check covers and found that nothing here or anywhere else reviews whether a practice's `tier` is still right
- **Extended 2026-09-11, Morgan F (strength: decided)**, so every repo in force is asked whether it still EXISTS and still accepts a push, not only whether the clone is current -- "make sure it doesn't automatically try to open a repo that doesn't exist / was deleted / archived"
- **Extended again 2026-09-11, Morgan F (strength: decided)**, so pass 3's session-load read covers every repo in force rather than this checkout alone, with the ceilings themselves moved out to session-load-budget
- **Extended again 2026-09-11, Morgan F (strength: decided)**, so every run records what each of its parts returned and what each cost into a ledger that outlives the run, and reads them against the runs before it -- "the check now has many different components and when you run it, I want you to track the results of each part and compare at the end to ... find any aspects of the very deep check that weren't useful"
- **Extended 2026-09-12, Morgan F (strength: decided)**, with the live-session sweep -- "do a sweep of live sessions against the repo to see if there's anything recent being missed" -- and with the branch sweep widened to every author and to work that landed on the base branch rather than the integration branch -- "find stale branches, even if worked on by someone else or in a different branch"
- **Extended again 2026-09-12, Morgan F (strength: decided)**, so a run against a repo whose work is pinned to an integration branch also reads the BASE branch for changes the branch has never taken, and puts them to the person rather than applying them -- "it should check main to see if there were any changes that we should update our version with so they don't get too out of sync; but those changes, don't implement automatically, but ask the session user if they want to implement them"
- **Extended 2026-09-12, PENDING REVIEW -- not yet approved by anyone -- with pass 2's does-it-ever-run question**, after a source set was measured running 12 of its 54 registered checks and skipping the other 42 for one cause, with the rule governing what its own published practice files may link among them
- **Extended again 2026-09-12, Morgan F (strength: decided)**, so the repository-visibility pass also carries the leak RECOMMENDATIONS the push gate used to print beside every run -- "you look to see if anything is being leaked that you think shouldn't be and you make the recommendation to me ... but only when I ask for it as part of a very thorough review I'm in the mindset of doing"
- **Extended 2026-09-14, Morgan F (strength: decided)**, so pass 1 rehearses a practice moved between levels and pass 3 reads every document that describes a mechanism against what that mechanism does now -- "does very deep check do a read of the documentation to make sure it's consistent with how it works now? If not add that too"
- **Extended 2026-09-14, Morgan F** -- after a session was refused by GitHub with a rate-limit error, he asked for the cause investigated, the fixes made, and this check to report the account's API limits so normal usage can be seen not to overspend them (strength: decided; the section's shape is the session's, the requirement is his)
- **Extended 2026-09-15, Morgan (strength: decided)**, so the branch sweep's list is written to a committable file with a clickable link on every row instead of only being printed, after two Sunday runs produced it and he never saw it -- "it should put those links in the document it creates so I can just go there and click - it shouldn't live in the chat"
- **Extended 2026-09-17, Morgan (strength: decided)**, with a pass-3 bullet asking whether every file, documentation included, lives in the directory its kind already uses -- "in very_deep_check, can you update it to make sure that files including documentation are in their right folder/location?" -- after two person-facing setup guides were found sitting at repo root while documentation/ held every other reader-facing page
- **Extended again 2026-09-17, Morgan (strength: decided)**, with a pass-2 item reading the harness-adapter ledger's verdicts for whether they are actually correct, not merely present -- "update the very deep check definition to do a focused and detailed check to make sure that the system works in each of the LLMs (codex gemini grok) cross-platform? I want this to detect errors where, a change was made to how we do something with Claude, but it wasn't rolled out to the others" -- after the same conversation found that `parallel-artifact-ledger`'s enforced check only proves a row exists per change, by its own docstring's admission, and a live example where two recent rows promised a codex or gemini-cli user a hand-run workaround that neither adapter's own README mentions anywhere
- **Extended again 2026-09-17, Morgan (strength: decided)**, with a pass-4 item that inventories every cron, scheduled workflow and session trigger across every repo and account in force, gives each a verdict, disables or deletes what nobody needs, and writes the whole list to a committed report -- "To very deep check, we should also add: a check of any crons or other automated actions - and delete or disable not needed ones, and to make a list of all of them that goes into the very deep check report"
- **Extended 2026-09-17 (written as "in the same turn"), Morgan (strength: decided)**, with a companion item closing the cheaper half of [todo-2026-09-07-undeclared-deprecated-files](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/todo/todo-2026-09-07-undeclared-deprecated-files.md) -- reading every mechanism in force against whether it is still the thing that runs, deleting what plainly is not, writing into the same report, and asking the session's user wherever a verdict is unclear -- "And also the same for any deprecated files - look for them, delete them, note it in the big document made with the findings. And if there is any doubt or questions, ask the session user"
- **Extended 2026-09-18, Morgan (strength: decided)**, so pass 2's item 17 names `grok-build/` as a fourth harness-adapter directory and drops the stale present-tense count that still read three -- "Fix the stale count in item #17 now, and add in the grok, please", after a session answering a question about this check found `templates/harness/grok-build/` already on disk, researched and dated 2026-09-17, un-named by either the item's own prose or `templates/harness/LEDGER.md`'s family line
- **Extended 2026-09-19, Morgan (strength: decided)**, so a session that runs less than the full four passes says so BEFORE running, never only in the honest write-up after -- "the whole point of 'very deep check' is to do a very deep check. If I wanted a light check, I wouldn't ask for a very deep check!", after a session ran only the mechanical half of passes 2 and 4 and reported the rest PARTIAL without flagging the narrowed scope up front
- **Extended again 2026-09-19, Morgan (strength: decided)**, so the checkout's merged-and-stale branch list is embedded, in full and never truncated, in [spec/VERY_DEEP_CHECK.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/spec/VERY_DEEP_CHECK.md) itself, written directly by the checkout's own branch scan rather than left for a session to remember to open and paste from [record/stale_branches.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/record/stale_branches.md) -- "This list should be generated and included in the VERY DEEP CHECK MD document when it's generated... And if there are more than 10, include them!", after a session named ten safe deletions without ever printing them and had to be asked for the list a second time
- **Extended 2026-09-21, Morgan F (strength: decided)**, with pass 1's adapter-parity item -- "everything in .claude should have its parallel for the others. This should also be a new item in very deep check: check everything unique to Claude and make sure there's a parallel for the three others"; the first run of it found that [templates/harness/README.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/templates/harness/README.md) had named [tools/bootstrap.sh](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/bootstrap.sh) as session-start.sh's parallel while the script ran three of the hook's seven steps
- **Bounded 2026-09-21, Morgan (strength: decided, relayed)** -- the branch sweep's delete-link mechanism moved to branch-delete-links and is cited here rather than restated, and this pass's branch scope was fixed at the checkout and its own source checkouts, never the fleet, which is chief-of-staff's
- **Extended 2026-09-21, Morgan (strength: decided)**, with pass 3's close read of every always-loaded instructions file, after an Update Vendors pass found a consuming repo's AGENTS.md naming a repository that does not exist, twice, in the same file whose own step 1 warns about a source name going stale silently
- **Extended 2026-09-21, Morgan (strength: decided)**, with the five additions [spec/VERY_DEEP_CHECK_DEEPENING_PROPOSAL.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/spec/VERY_DEEP_CHECK_DEEPENING_PROPOSAL.md) recommended first and he authorized in that order -- the planted-case rotation settled at step 2 (item 11), WORKFLOW REALITY and the YAML-anchor check (item 5), the deletion rehearsal and DELETIONS PENDING (items 1 and 2), INCIDENT COVERAGE (item 12) and the ACCRETION ranking with its holistic-read registry (item 9); the first forced harness run the new step 2 asked for turned the suite red on its own rotation self-test, which is the kind of thing the item exists to surface
- **Extended 2026-09-21, Morgan (strength: decided)**, with the carry-through roll-up (CARRY-THROUGH, proposal item 3) and the identity read off the commits that landed (IDENTITY REALITY, item 8) -- "Is there a next step to build in your very deep check plan? Build it!"; the first run of the second found four of the five repos in force carrying commits with an author-date offset that is not the declared timezone
- **Extended 2026-09-21, Morgan (strength: decided)**, with the ACTIONS FLOOR bill (proposal item 7) and the CONFIG KEYS sweep (item 10) -- "Build the next part of very deep check according to the plan"; the required-status-check item was weighed first and held, because this session measured the protection endpoint answering "Resource not accessible by integration" and a section that can only ever print UNVERIFIED here is the cost the component ledger exists to catch
- **Extended 2026-09-21, Morgan (strength: decided)**, with the deletion-propagation table (proposal item 4), the CHECK COVERAGE enumeration (item 13, closing pass 2 question 15's own unbuilt half) and MOVED CLAIMS (item 14) -- "now build the next ones"; item 4's table found on its first asking that a hook dropped upstream has no removal path at all, and item 14's first run found the paused-workflow incident still live in one source
- **Extended 2026-09-22, Morgan (strength: decided)**, with FIX SWEEP (proposal item 13's other half) -- "Build item 13's fix-sweep half, go update"; its first run carried the YAML-anchor detector built three days earlier into all three shared sources, two of which decline for having no workflow file and the third of which runs clean
- **Extended 2026-09-23, Morgan (strength: decided)**, with pass 3's SOURCE-placement question, after asking for a cross-repo practice-placement review across the five Precedent repos and finding that nothing here or anywhere else ever asks which catalogue a practice belongs in, only whether its tier within one catalogue is right -- the session's own review is the bullet's worked example, five practices moved out of precedent-individual, two demoted from universal, and one live duplicate (vendor-neutral-by-default) found still open
- **Extended again 2026-09-23, Morgan (strength: decided)**, with the PRACTICE CATALOGUE section -- asked directly for a list of every practice by slug with one sentence each, across this repo, the individual source and the shared sources, generated the same way every time a very deep check runs so it can be reviewed against; built to reuse each practice's own `index_clause` rather than compose a second description, and to write into [spec/VERY_DEEP_CHECK.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/spec/VERY_DEEP_CHECK.md) directly rather than leave a session to remember to paste it, the same lesson the embedded stale-branch list already carries
- **Bounded 2026-09-24, Morgan (strength: decided, "Go update")**, gating what the PRACTICE CATALOGUE section commits by the repo's own `visibility` -- "it posts your precedent-individual and the precedet-\* ones to the list in the main repo so (if it's a public repo) it will become public... it should advise the user first and ask him if he'd rather get the list of practices in the deep review doc, in the chat, or he doesn't want it" -- after the section's first run had already committed every source's clauses into this public repo's tracked file unconditionally; fixed by reusing `build_views.py`'s existing `repo_is_public()`/`sources_for_tracked_block()` rather than a second filter, so the console output still carries everything, chat-only and free, while the committed file holds back every individual and shared source and names them, with the choice put back to the person rather than decided either way
- **Replaced 2026-09-28, Morgan (strength: decided, "Go update")**: the practice catalogue is no longer committed anywhere. Every run writes a session-only review page instead (`tools/precedent_review_page.py`): the branches the person can delete, with a link each, and every active practice by source, private sets included, published in the session and never linked from a repository.
- **Extended 2026-09-28, Morgan (strength: decided, "Go update, fix all four. Note that it needs to never never offer to delete pre-staging nor staging.")**, for the pre-staging -> staging -> main tiers: the branch sweep never offers a tier branch for deletion, the drift scan asks of every tier pair, the endgame rehearsal covers the Promote into staging as well as the one into main, and pass 1's move rehearsal reads the mentions a move now fixes. Asked first as a question ("does anything in very deep check need to be changed due to our new pre-staging -> staging -> main approach?"); the four fixes were the session's proposal, which he chose to take whole.
- **Extended 2026-09-29, Morgan (strength: decided)**, with the review page's third list, practices that may overlap, after asking whether the check looked for redundant or very similar practices in different repos and in the same one. Nothing did mechanically: the within-source scan caught a duplicate `defines:` term or a sibling override, and pass 3's placement read asked the question by hand. The script proposes pairs; the session judges them.
- **Extended 2026-09-29, Morgan (strength: decided)**, so a renamed repository is found wherever it is named -- every tracked file in this checkout and in every source, not only the always-loaded instructions files -- and fixed in the run: the clone's remote repointed and every current reference rewritten, history left as written. Asked as a question first ("does Very Deep Check do a check to see if any called repos are redirected ... add that to VDC if it doesn't"); it reported renames in two places and fixed none.
- **Extended 2026-09-29, Morgan (strength: decided)**, with the GENERATED FILES lines: the reverse search for a file a tool writes that the new list of generated files does not name. Asked as a question ("does bestpractice maintain a list of all files that are auto-generated ... Is this checked in VDC and/or should it be?"); there was no single list, and todo/TODO.md had gone out of date with nothing checking it.
- **Extended 2026-10-01, Morgan (strength: decided)**, so Pass 3 measures every always-loaded surface against its target as well as its ceiling, and over target runs a reduction pass with its practice-by-practice review of the occasion index and resident block -- "this reduction pass is great; if it's not part of Very Deep Check, it absolutely should be." -- after the first such review found about 1,040 tokens of room that the menu's lossless moves could not. The SESSION LOAD section prints an OVER TARGET finding for it.
- **Extended 2026-10-06, Morgan (strength: decided)**, with the RETIRED SETS section: a declared set that says it is retired, or that GitHub reports archived, is reported with the command that drops it, and Update Vendors drops it on its own -- only when no active rule would be lost, and never on "Not Found". He chose that option ("C") from three put to him. Carried into this copy on 2026-10-06 (Morgan, approving the very deep check's fixes, strength: decided).
- **Extended 2026-10-06, Morgan (strength: decided)**, so the review page is always published as an Artifact and never handed over as an HTML file, after a run sent it as an attached file: "That HTML doc - give me that info as an artifact - and update very deep check so that in the future, that is always an artifact, not a HTML file." Both tools that write or announce the page now say so in what they print.

Copied into this set on 2026-10-02 under the same slug, when the ladder became a set a person brings (spec/LADDER_OPT_IN_PLAN.md in BestPractice). For a person who brings this set it replaces the universal rule of the same name, so they read it in the ladder's words exactly as before; everyone else reads the universal copy, which says the same thing without them. Edit both.

## Install
[tools/very_deep_check.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/very_deep_check.py) enumerates the scope
(this checkout's own top-level documents plus every active source's
`practices/*.md` tree, reusing
[tools/precedent_resolve.py](../tools/precedent_resolve.py)'s own source
resolution) and prints this practice's Detail section — read from this file
at run time rather than kept as a second copy
inside the script, so the passes the tool prints cannot drift from the
passes defined here. No mechanical `checked_by` exists for this practice's
own Rule, and can't: what it asks for is a session's judgment applied to a
scope the tool enumerates, the same class of resistant-to-automation
practice `full-practice-audit` and `mistakes-become-rules` already name. See
[full-practice-audit](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/full-practice-audit.md) for the narrower,
already-built sibling this one deliberately does not replace, and
[spec/UNBUILT_PLAN_ITEMS.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/spec/UNBUILT_PLAN_ITEMS.md) for the decision
record this practice's own build closes out.

Eight parts of the check *are* mechanical, as far as a mechanical check can
reach (`checkable-gets-checked`): every repo in force is fetched and
compared against its origin before the tool reads a line, and anything but
provably-current exits non-zero (`--allow-stale` for a deliberately offline
run) — with `--freshen` fast-forwarding a clean tree that is strictly
behind, and declining a diverged or dirty one, where a fast-forward
discards commits; a missing declared shared or individual source is a hard,
non-zero-exit failure by default (pass `--allow-missing-sources` only when
proceeding without it is actually intended); every tracked JSON and YAML file is parsed with a real parser
(pass 2's format-claims question), and a file that does not parse stops the
run, since the tool
reads `precedent.json` to enumerate its own scope; each shared and individual
source is checked against the shape its bootstrap skeleton ships, catching a
source migrated into place that never passed through bootstrap; and both
halves of the branch sweep are real git checks — `merge-base --is-ancestor`
against each repo's own `origin/HEAD` (or an explicit `--target` for this
checkout when its integration branch isn't its default one, this repo's own
`precedent-beta-v01` being exactly that case) for merged-and-undeleted, and
`git cherry` for how many of an unmerged branch's commits have no
patch-equivalent on that target. Sixth, the endgame merge is rehearsed: the
integration branch is merged into its base in a throwaway worktree (detached,
nothing committed, removed on every exit path), and the paths present on the
branch but absent from the result are reported separately from the
conflicting ones — `--skip-endgame-merge` to skip it, `--json` for the full
list rather than the first ten. It reports CANNOT TELL, never clean, when
the two branches have no common ancestor in this clone: an under-fetched
history yields an empty difference that reads exactly like a good result.
Its negative control is
[tools/verify_harness.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/verify_harness.py)'s
`check_endgame_merge_finds_the_silent_drop`, which plants one file of each
class and asserts *which path lands in which set by name* — a count would
have passed while reproducing the original miss
([control-asserts-which-failure](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/control-asserts-which-failure.md)).
Seventh, and only where the branch this repo works on is not its base
branch, the base branch is read for commits with no patch-equivalent on the
branch — `git cherry` again, so work carried across in another shape is not
reported as missing — and the result is printed for a person to decide
about. It merges nothing and writes nothing, by design, and
`--skip-base-drift` skips it. Its negative control is that same harness's
`check_base_branch_drift_ignores_carried_work`, which plants one carried and
one stranded commit and asserts *which subject comes back by name*: a count
would pass on an implementation that listed both, and a list that is mostly
work already here is one a reader waves through whole. Eighth, the practice
catalogue: every in-force practice's slug and its own `index_clause`, read
straight off `practices/*.md` frontmatter with no judgment applied, so two
runs against an unchanged catalogue print byte-identical rows, onto the
session-only review page (`tools/precedent_review_page.py`), never into a
committed file.

What stays a session step, deliberately: the branch sweep's other half —
turning a mechanically-merged branch into a *reported* one requires knowing
which PR it came from, who drove it, and that PR's URL, none of which an
offline `git` check can see; a closed-but-not-provably-merged branch is the
same story one layer out, where only the session, reading that branch's PR
thread, can tell "superseded" from "abandoned, still someone's open
question" — and, on the unmerged side, whether nineteen commits nobody
merged were meant to land at all, which is the verdict itself and the one
thing here no scan can supply. Pass 1's fixtures are a session step for the same reason in a
different form: building a fresh install and a migration and then judging
what the documents failed to say is not a thing a script can assert about
itself, and a scripted install would test the script rather than the
instructions an adopter actually follows.

**The report file was Morgan's, 2026-09-15**, and it named a run that had
already happened twice without it: he asked for the branch sweep across
this repo and every vendored one, "including links... so I can delete
them," and could not point to having received it from the Sunday run —
"I don't remember getting that when we ran it on Sunday (and I ran it
twice on Sunday — the second one short but the first time long)." The
sweep and its links were not missing; the ANSWER was, because it existed
only in that Sunday session's own transcript and nobody carried it
forward. **The fix is not a smarter sweep — `scan_branches` and
`_branch_url` already computed everything asked for — it is a place for
the answer to live that isn't a chat window**: `_write_branch_report()`
writes the same rows to `record/stale_branches.md`, committed like
`MAP.md` or the run ledger, so the next person who wants the list opens a
page instead of asking a session to reproduce one.

**The cheap-default correction was Morgan's, 2026-09-19**, after
a session asked for a very deep check ran only the mechanical half of
passes 2 and 4 — the tool's own scans and the deep-check gate suite — and
recorded passes 1 and 3, and the real half of pass 4, as PARTIAL or not run,
without saying so before it started. Told this in a follow-up, the session
explained itself honestly: it had scoped the run down given the size of what
was actually there, "rather than committing 30-40 minutes upfront without
checking... That was my call to make it move quickly, not a technical limit."
The correction was one sentence: *"the whole point of 'very deep check' is
to do a very deep check. If I wanted a light check, I wouldn't ask for a
very deep check!"* The rule above already required a skipped pass to be
recorded honestly, and the session did that; what it did not do was ask, or
even say out loud, before quietly substituting a faster check for the one
asked for. An honest log of a choice nobody agreed to is not the same thing
as the choice being fine.

**The embedded stale-branch list was Morgan's too, later the same day
(strength: decided)**, and it is the same lesson landing a second time in a
narrower place. The corrected run committed `record/stale_branches.md` and
told him ten branches were safe to delete — then never actually printed
them, so he had to ask *"Don't you have to give me in the very deep check a
list of the stale branches to review?"* before getting one. Handed the
list, he deleted all ten in the same turn and named the fix precisely:
*"This list should be generated and included in the VERY DEEP CHECK MD
document when it's generated... And if there are more than 10, include
them!"* — pointing at [spec/VERY_DEEP_CHECK.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/spec/VERY_DEEP_CHECK.md)
by name, not `record/stale_branches.md`, and ruling out any version that
truncates. A committed file a session has to remember to open and paste
from is the same shape of loss as a Sunday run's stdout — just one file
closer to durable — so the fix is not "remember to paste it next time," it
is removing the step that can be forgotten:
`tools/very_deep_check.py --emit merged-stale-checkout` plus a block the
checkout's own branch scan writes directly on every real run. The first
version of this fix registered the block with `tools/doc_sync.py`, the
mechanism every other script-computed table in this repository uses, and
that failed its own first CI run: the live GitHub fetch the emitter makes
has no reproducible answer inside the harness's scratch-copy fixtures, so
the gate reported drift unrelated to whatever it was actually testing.
Corrected the same day to write the block directly instead of gating it.

**The dedup ledger, 2026-09-20** (Story above). `_convergent_drift()` reads
`sources` — the same list `BOOTSTRAP DRIFT` already gathers — and, for each
converged file, checks every involved set's own
`very-deep-check-decisions.json` for an entry keyed `("CONVERGENT DRIFT",
<file path>)`. **A repo with no such file, or `sources` omitted entirely, is
unaffected** — every call site that predates this change kept working
exactly as before, which is what makes this additive rather than a breaking
change to a section other checks already depend on. When every set sharing
a convergence has recorded the *same* one of the four fixed verdicts
(`intentional-customization`, `template-candidate`, `stale-shared-build`,
`tracked-elsewhere`) and no entry's `revisit` date has passed, the line
prints `DECIDED` instead of `FINDING` — visible, not silent, the same
"quiet is not the same as useless" principle this file states elsewhere for
a guard that never fires. Disagreement between sets, a decision by only
some of them, or a `revisit` date that has passed all still print the
ordinary `FINDING`, annotated with whatever is already on record rather
than reprinted from zero. A ledger entry naming a file no longer present in
that set prints its own `ORPHANED LEDGER ENTRY` line, matching the
`ORPHANS` section's own philosophy of naming a stale record instead of
dropping it quietly. The verdict is never written automatically — same
manual, dated, quoted-judgment shape as `identity.json`'s
`grandfathered_commit_shas`, which this design is modeled on directly.

**It stopped being engine-only on 2026-09-21.** `scope: engine-dev` kept
this practice out of a consuming repo's materialized tree, on the reasoning
that the occasion could only ever fire inside the engine's own repository —
which was true for exactly as long as
[tools/very_deep_check.py](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/tools/very_deep_check.py)
lived only here. The tool is vendored now, so the premise is gone, and the
scope was doing active harm: a person said "very deep check" in their own
project, the session did not have the practice, and the word meant nothing
there. **A standing command a session cannot carry out is worse than one
that does not exist** — the person says it, and nothing happens for a
reason nobody can see.

What a consumer's run covers is narrower, and the tool says so rather than
pretending: passes that name a tool the consumer does not vendor are
reported as not run, not silently skipped.
