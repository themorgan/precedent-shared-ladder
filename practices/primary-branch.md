## Rule
**"Primary branch" is this repo's own word for trunk** -- the one shared
branch regular work pushes to and pull requests target, whatever any one
repository happens to call it. Saying it does not itself trigger an action:
[go-update](go-update.md) already resolves a bare instruction to this
branch by default. This practice exists
so the word has a definition a session -- and a person -- can look up,
rather than one only ever spelled out inline inside those two.

**The repository declares it**: `base_branch` in its `precedent.json`, or
a rule of its own that names it. In most repositories that is `main`.
Absent a declaration, it is whichever branch the repository's own routine
work is actually developed and committed against -- never a configured
default chosen just because it is configured that way.

**Under the branch tiers it is the branch this person's Booked (`Go update`) lands
on** ([spec/BRANCH_TIERS_PLAN.md](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/spec/BRANCH_TIERS_PLAN.md)):
`python3 tools/precedent_branches.py --landing` names it: the person's own
`landing_branch` (identity.json) if set, else the repository's
(precedent.json), else `staging` (Morgan, 2026-09-27, strength: decided). On
the ladder that is `staging` since 2026-10-09, landed with
`python3 tools/precedent_branches.py --land` (Morgan, "Act on the ladder
plan"; `pre-staging` before). Main is then what the primary branch is
promoted into, never where routine work is pushed.
Morgan, 2026-09-25: *"we now have a concept called \"primary branch\" -
that should probably be updated in reference to this"* (strength:
decided).

**A branch rule belongs to the repository that made it.** A repository that
stages its work on a branch other than `main` says so in its own files, and
that rule never travels to the repositories that take updates from it: in
each of those, the primary branch is whatever *that* repository declares.
Morgan, 2026-09-24, about the one catalogue repository that does this:
*"this rule doesn't get vendored in anywhere, the primary branch of the
vendored-in repo should be used, often main."* The tiers are the one
exception: `staging` and `main` (and `pre-staging`, where one is still in
use) are the same names in every repository, so that part travels like any other practice.

## Why
"Primary branch" and "trunk" name the same thing, but neither had been
written down as this project's own vocabulary before now -- so a question
like "was everything pushed to trunk?" had no guarantee of being read the
same way a bare "push directly" already resolves to that branch. Naming it
once, with a `command:` entry, puts it in the
[vocabulary](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/vocabulary.md) listing without a session inferring the mapping
fresh in every conversation.

## Story
Coined 2026-09-22: asked what word developers use for the branch
push-directly (retired 2026-09-30) already called "the primary branch," told
it was "trunk" in general developer usage, Morgan asked for the two to be
tied together in the project's own vocabulary rather than left as a private
mapping I'd have to re-derive each time.

**2026-10-09: staging is the ladder's primary branch.** The ladder redesign Morgan approved that day (`spec/LADDER_REDESIGN_PLAN.md`) moved where Booked lands from pre-staging to staging.

## Install
No check on the answer, same reason [vocabulary](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/blob/staging/practices/vocabulary.md) gives --
this defines a word, it does not check that a session used it. What's
checked is the generated copy: `python3 tools/build_views.py` regenerates
this row into AGENTS.md's loader block and the reader-facing table, same as
every other command entry (practice: registry-source-of-truth).
